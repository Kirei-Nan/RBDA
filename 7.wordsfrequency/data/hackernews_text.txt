2013-10-26 23:38:50.000	I think this chain of articles is particularly interesting to follow because it neatly illustrates how different the audiences are the articles neatly show both what the audience wants to hear and what it actually hears. This is a property of blogs in general they can measure the impact of any given article far more than newspapers, so less popular views can t ride the coattails of more popular ones. This creates a pretty direct feedback loop blogs write more of what people want and, to an extent, people want more of what blogs write.Also, reading some of these articles really illustrated your point about blame--it seems the writers are more than ready to play an us vs game them with privileged technocrats or a techno-utopian clique against the implicit common man in the audience. Instead of comparing ideals and ideas, it focuses on people behind the ideas and their perceived arrogance. This is particularly annoying because arrogance seems disproportionately harshly judged by society.

Even without the market manipulation, there s no way a company like Google could operate without a clear separation between departments. The reason for that is that centuries of playing that game have shown that it s the only way to keep market makers honest.

2011-05-03 00:38:45.000	Singapore does invest heavily in education and with great results. Since the discussion is about prison population and expenses, though, it s worth mentioning that Singapore s correctional regularly employs executions rather than paying to for the housing and correctional officers necessary to hold a prisoner for decades. Also, unlike the US, where executions are extremely difficult, controversial and expensive, they re efficient and cheap.It s hard to dispute the economic success of Singapore s model, but it s not one that any western countries could or would emulate.

2022-08-05 04:55:27.000	While climate changes have always existed, there are now at least 2 important differences, which will make this warming much more dangerous for the terrestrial plants and non-human animals.One difference is that the rate of warming is very high now, probably much higher than ever before. At least where I live, in Europe, the climate has changed dramatically in less than 1 human lifetime and now it is extremely different from how it was when I was young.The second difference is that now all larger wild animals and wild plants will no longer be able to react to climate like they did before, when they migrated towards the south or towards the north, depending on the climate evolution.Now the terrestrial part of the Earth is mostly occupied by humans, crops and domestic animals, while the remaining wild plants and animals are mainly in islands scattered over the lands. This will make impossible a gradual retreat of the wildlife towards some more appropriate climate and they cannot make plans like humans, e.g. that they should travel 100 km through some inhospitable land, because at the end there would be a suitable biotope.Of course, among the terrestrial wildlife, the best chances for surviving a climate change will be for those who can reach far distances through the air, over the man-made obstacles, e.g. plants with airborne seeds, birds, bats, insects, spiders and other very small living beings that can be carried by the wind, or by birds or insects.In any case, it is pretty certain that this warming will be much more destructive for the wildlife than any other before.

2018-04-23 15:36:37.000	I also had a deja-vu moment. When I began to study CS a professor of us really tried to get us into electrical engineering instead of CS. His basic argument was, that in 10 years programmers will basically be unemployed or on the verge of it, because even nowdays there are visual code generators that can create better code than most programmers could. That was 2004 and I think he was referring to LabVIEW.A lot of things have happened since then, but LabVIEW is still very much a niche application for a very specific domain. And code generators didn t magically abstract away integration, requirements optimization, scaling and architectural desision making.

2020-11-08 03:46:46.000	These are all excellent points in favor of productivity with GraphQL. I always avoid new technologies for a few years to let the hype cycle mature for example, everybody talking about how great mongodb is and writing blog posts about how they migrated, followed two years later by everybody talking about how terrible mongodb is and how they had to migrate to posgresql . As a dev working on a commercial software project, especially if you re in leadership, you have to look very carefully at every technology you introduce into your stack, because you are going to be supporting it for years. If it turns out to be the wrong decision, or you get caught out by a bunch of edge cases that weren t well known in the early days, you can end up losing millions of dollars in productivity, and possibly killing the company when you can t fix bugs and ship new features. So I ve been suspicious of GraphQL, but keeping an eye on it. I still don t know if the productivity gains you get up front are actually technical debt in disguise, but if that turns out not to be the case, and it really is a matter of only having to write one query instead of making five requests and several dozen lines of types, validators, and async redux middleware, I ll be happy to adopt it in the future.
2013-04-29 15:10:12.000	A friend of ours is a very talented fiddle player and she got invited to jam with Amanda on stage. She was thrilled, naturally.This whole incident serves to remind me that many people apparently have no idea that folk music exists. Yes, people routinely spend tens of thousands of hours mastering multiple musical instruments in order to be able to play for themselves, for their family and friends, and for random passers-by for free. Yes, folk musicians sometimes get paid to play, but can also be expected to be found jamming away in hallways, tents, parking lots and living rooms with fellow musicians and fans - there is no real line between a musician and a fan. And the privilege of jamming along with one of your musical idols is not something one expects to be paid for indeed, a relatively modern innovation in folk and bluegrass is the formal music camp , where the students pay for this privilege.
2018-10-02 19:37:09.000	We ll see. It seems that this debate has quickly polarized.The Model 3 is still wildly expensive. The ones being shipped now aren t affordable cars. 35k really isn t affordable for a car either. It s firmly in the luxury market until 35k models ship. Even then, it doesn t make financial sense to buy a Tesla over another car without government incentives.Charge time is a major issue and will be critical for Tesla to solve.Durability and reliability for high miles remains to be seen. Batteries are expensive to replace.As for manufacturing, mechanically electric vehicles are far simpler. I highly doubt there is much more to be gained from manufacturing improvements, and most of the car already benefits from the already existing economy of scale on hardware and metal forming. The issue is 1000 the battery. Everything with Tesla hinges on that battery - making it cheaper, more reliable, longer lasting. That s the hard part - because increasing range decreases efficiency because of the size and weight of the battery.I m excited - I think with any changes that can disrupt a business a lot of resistance will be faced. But I hope Tesla succeeds.

2014-12-08 20:18:15.000	This one is actually true and interesting for real. If you haven t heard of this before i highly recommend reading up about it.When measuring random things in nature, regardless of what unit and base you use to measure inches, cm, m, feet, etc , measurements with lower first digit appear more frequent than others! This is due to things in nature usually being exponentially distributed, when you have an exponential distribution you will move away faster from higher valued digits and reach the next power of ten faster, there you will restart with a low first digits which is slow to move away from. For example, assuming a spread of about 50 , then 1 50 1.5 still starting with 1 but 5 50 7.5 not starting with same digit , and 8 50 12 starting with 1 again .

Personally I ve written code for the iphone and android. I d avoid any of the older phones that don t provide some sort of API. Your initial users presumably will be techies with newer phones. If you have some initial success you can add support for older phones that don t have a friendly API.

2017-12-12 11:41:59.000	I can t see how an algorithm to lookup bit i in a compressed bitmap of size n can ever be constant time.No matter how the bitmap is compressed, the block storage space for b bits of the bitmap cannot be constant since it s impossible to always compress b bits of arbitrary data into fewer than b bits .So, to find bit i in the compressed form, you are going to have to parse the compressed data. A naive approach would just linearly read through the compressed data, giving O n . Alternatively, the data structure could contain indexes, pointing to various places in the bitmap. You could get the cost down to O log n by making your index contain pointers to a binary subdivision of the bitmap. But we re still not constant time.If you index every x bits, the cost drops to O x . To reach constant time, you would need to index every bit in the bitmap, which obviously cannot be done without creating a data structure bigger than the original bitmap. Edit fixed my misuse of linear constant time!

How was that initial decision made in the first place? Was it Elon Musk snapping his fingers like Thanos? And then to turn it around in less than week shows a complete misread of the situation. Whoever made that initial decision should be fired, including Elon Musk.I think Elon Musk has great vision, but he is in over his head with running and growing the company. He needs to hand the reins over to something who is better at this than he is. His behavior, including calling a person a pedophile, tweeting about going private, and fighting the SEC over Twitter shows a person who is mentally unfit to be a CEO. This last decision really cements it, and the company, employees and shareholders could truly suffer going forward if he continues as CEO.

If a bunch of other factors work out with just that one adjustment, that s pretty good validation that that one adjustment is meaningful.I agree, but isn t that basically what MOND does too? It made one small tweak to gravity, and all of a sudden we can successfully predict a range of galaxy properties with a pretty tight margin for all galaxies, where LCDM can t make such precise predictions because each galaxy s DM distribution can only be tuned after its been observed, and the number of free parameters needed for tuning means the margin is very wide. That s great for MOND but doesn t bode well for LCDM.From direct observations, MOND is strong where LCDM is weak and vice versa. I think LCDM just gets too much credit and more alternatives need to be tried. There s almost certainly something to MOND because the observations it matches and the successful predictions it made would be too coincidental otherwise.

With a bad historical precedent however, an otherwise harmless joke reinforces and reinvigorates past discrimination and marginalization, and actively contributes to a hostile culture and specifically a hostile work environment in this case.Just because you wouldn t be offended by something doesn t mean lots of other people aren t, or that your harmless and thoughtless jokes aren t deeply offensive and repugnant for historical reasons you possibly haven t considered.

I don t even have Brett Ratner on there yet.I ve also thought about rating or categorizing the allegations in a more systematic way, but it would be difficult to do well. Any sort of rating system seems like it could be easy to mess up. Point taken about Weinstein or Cosby being at the same level as, say, Ben Affleck. Perhaps grouping them by ranges of accusers would work eg, 1, 2-5 , 6-10 , 10 .One possible feature could be whether someone was convicted of an offense. That should be pretty straightforward and wouldn t involve any editorializing.

2018-09-18 05:28:56.000	The crime rates are nearly similar among all races Do you have any stats to back that up? Everything I find says the opposite.A Channel 4 News fact check says Blacks were disproportionately likely to commit homicide and to be the victims. In 2008 the offending rate for blacks was seven times higher than for whites and the victimisation rate was six times higher. You can look at the stats yourself See Page 3 Table 2. This is the Bureau of Justice Statistics National Crime Victimization Survey where they ask victims of violent crime demographic information about the offenders. This avoids any question of bias from the arrest rates. Doing the math, black people offend at a rate 2.4x higher than whites.I disagree that whites are left off the hook The probability of arrest given the commission of a crime is higher for whites than it is for blacks for robbery, aggravated assault, and simple assault, whereas for rape the probability of arrest is approximately equal across offender race. tried to find data about offender rate for property crime, but every discussion said that since the victims don t encounter the offenders, there is no good way to estimate offender race.I m not defending anything in American history. I just want to set the facts straight.

2022-08-18 11:14:22.000	Perfectly reasonable way to read it, and maybe even how it s intended.Actually the full judgement 0 is a bit clearer that that s exactly what how it s intended, but not in a jingoistic nationalist way.One argument in this case was that there ARE crimes which are justiciable in the UK which are not committed within the UK or its territorial water, treason, murder, bigamy, and offences committed on British-flagged ships on the High Seas, I think child molestation was mentioned by OP, but not in this court case I m not sure about this one, although it wouldn t surprise me if it s on the list .So it is both possible and precedented for parliament to pass laws which, when broken, would fall under the jurisdiction of British courts even if the offence itself did not take place in the UK. But this isn t one of those cases. This is as opposed to e.g. the US, where ordinary laws are actually bound by a constitution.The UK also has a constitution, it s just not consolidated in a single document. Parliament is bound by a variety of restrictions on what they can and can t do in terms of passing laws. However, it is, of course, possible to change these restrictions, or pass the law despite them, similarly to how it is possible to amend the US constitution, and pass a law which is later found to be unconstitutional by SCOTUS.I believe similarly to the US, any law can be passed, and if its constitutionality is challenged, then there is a Supreme Court who will pass a judgement, and so apart from the simplicity of having a consolidated and codified US constitution, there s no major difference between the two countries in that respect any law found to be unconstitutional will be considered void.Agree completely though that basically no-one cares enough to try to sort this out.I m not even sure what mechanism there would be for doing so? To actively police Sealand until a crime occurs, so that the perpetrator could be arrested and brought for trial to see if the judge would consider Sealand under their jurisdiction this time? 0

I suppose some of the backlash is to remove plausible deniability of dog whistling, but it s gone further than I think is reasonable. Besides, an honest person will apologise unreservedly when called out on accidental usage, whereas a dog whistling racist will tend to backtrack and mumble excuses.Anyway, you can still say a lot of harmful stuff without using a specific word if you want. I don t see the point. I recall hearing about a young popular YouTuber about a year or so ago who was accused of being racist simply for singing along to the lyrics of a popular rap song.Oh it gets sillier than that. The rapper invited the woman, who identified herself only as Delaney , to sing M.A.A.D City during his set at the Hangout Festival in Alabama.But Kendrick stopped her after she repeatedly used the N-word - which is heard multiple times in his song.As the crowd reacted angrily, Kendrick told her You gotta bleep one single word.

2020-09-30 15:56:34.000	In my experience, the vast majority of employees don t want their workplace to become a political battleground. Even those who occasionally discuss politics at work and are mature enough to behave like adults about it.It s tempting to think of this in terms of Democrats vs Republicans or right vs left, but that s not really the domain of the most problematic employees. The most problematic employees are the ones who have given up on the notion of reasonable debate or disagreement and instead have become convinced that the other side is committing acts so terrible that fighting them at every juncture is the only acceptable thing to do. Strangely enough, the other side isn t just far-right or fad-left people, it becomes centrists, or people who don t vote, or people who don t want to engage in politics at work.When you ve reached the point where a small handful of employees are fomenting outrage at their company for not putting a BLM statement on the company Twitter account, for example, the situation has arrived at a with us or against us false dichotomy.Generally, the only way to win with politics at the office is to not play. However, when one side decides that not playing is equivalent to being evil, everyone is forced to play. When everyone is forced to play by a handful of disgruntled employees, everyone loses.Paying to remove these people from a company makes a lot of sense. If you don t do something to remove them, the people who are sick of being dragged into political debates at work will slowly diffuse out of the company. The hyper-political employees are a loud minority, but the people who just want to do their jobs and remain professional are very much more common. Don t let the tail wag the dog.
2022-05-20 13:17:01.000	That s definitely the way management wants you to work, and it s worth trying to see how it works out. But in many cases it s not in your personal best interest.In those cases, there s a way to keep management happy and yourself too 1 Realize that when management asks for time estimates, they don t want your median estimate, because you ll be late half the time and that messes up their scheduling. Give them an estimate that you ll meet at least 90 of the time.2 This means in almost half the cases, you ll have extra time. You can give some of that back to management, but use some of the time to fix technical debt. The more debt, the more of the time you spend fixing it.3 With less technical debt, you can speed up your estimates and still be at that 90 level. Now you re delivering as much as if you let management fill your time in the first place. Your code magically has fewer bugs, there aren t many unexpected delays, and you almost always meet your deadlines. But you still have plenty of free time to improve things even more, develop your skills, etc.As a bonus, you have more of a sense of agency, which is an important factor in feeling happy at work.

2021-02-04 04:10:03.000	You say programmatic design qualities but I actually think a senior developer is more productive because they enhance team health by creating vision, mentoring junior devs, and effectively articulating their vision. This ultimately is the difference can you expand your productivity by setting the team s pace and get others bought into a vision on how things should be done? If no, you could be the smartest tech wizard in the world, I m not sure you d be an effective senior dev.A senior dev helps ensure the team is healthy. What s a good team?- Do they get sh t done. Do they deliver what they need to? Does it ultimately work?- Do they work well with others. Do they serve their customers and stakeholders? Or are they perceived as a bunch of a-holes?- Do they have a healthy mix of new talent ideas and seniority?- Does the team develop emotional safety and trust? Are constructive differences of opinion brought into the open, or is dissent stifled causing conflict to fester?- Do they know what they re after? Have they self organized around shared culture, principles, and working practices for getting there?A good senior dev is like one of the team captains . The team captain is a top player that pushes the other players to produce, but also learns how to leverage and mentor fellow teammates in the game.

The fact that part of the government did something illegal in no way justifies undermining national security goals if those two are not related.Snowden clearly did not do the only thing that could have been done. He did release documents selectively, therefore he could have chosen to not release the foreign surveillance information.All governments do bad things. That justifies whistleblowing. It never justifies an attack on the country s international security by its own citizens. In case you handn t noticed, other powerful states have no qualms about cyberwarefare.

The idea of being able to move all of your content to another social network at a whim, with all your connections undisturbed, is IMO simply never going to be something that your average user does, no matter how technically feasible it is.Hopefully I m wrong and I m not giving enough credit to social media users in aggregate.

He rejects resl politik, the idea that America needs to intervene aggressively abroad to maintain its interests. Democrats will oppose particular interventions, like Iraq, but as Kosovo and Syria demonstrate, they don t really reject the basic idea of America as the world s police.He had very different ideas about the division between federal and state power than the mainstream. Americans are more or less over the idea of federalism, as demonstrated by the popularity of Social Security, Medicare, highways, etc. On both sides, they mostly just want the federal government to tell states what to do. So when Ron Paul comes along opposing things like the Department of Education, he gets viewed as wildly out of the mainstream.

2023-10-02 19:12:36.000	I find it especially funny when anti-malware tools flag things like 4k intros or even smaller demoscene production.The people doing that are shaving bytes, fitting music and 3D graphics in self-contained executables smaller than many HN posts. Having enough space for malware after that would be insane.The reason these are often flagged as malware is that they are typically using runtime compression and a variety of tricks to save space, these techniques are unusual in legitimate programs and common in malware. Malware scanners could add support for the likes of crinkler and kkrunchy, but these are probably too niche to care.
2020-12-09 00:11:26.000	I think it s worth noting that attacks on judges is probably more detrimental to society than most murders. It s similar for elected office, which is one reason we have these special protections.That said, I agree with you. As Judge Salas says herself in this article, this is about the foundations of democracy. Peerage is certainly that too.Also, since prosecutors and police are covered by this law, we need to think of this as mostly relating to law enforcement. They are the vast majority of this population.Meanwhile, privacy is obviously an area that needs 21st century attention. We should at least get a reason why we don t get these protections too. Extending their rights to privacy separately from everyone else doesn t sit right with me.

2017-10-26 17:58:19.000	I don t understand how a land value tax is supposed to make rents lower. It doesn t really compute.As a landlord, I have a mortgage of X and taxes of Y, and insurances, maintenance and other liabilities that total up to Z, for operating costs on a piece of property.For this to make any sense at all, Rent X Y Z.If you increase the taxes Y and this would, realistically, be done more or less uniformly across a town or municipal region, so all properties are going to be in the same boat , all you ve done is make me have to charge a correspondingly higher rent. Rounded up to the nearest 25 or 50, because that s how it is always done. Meanwhile all the other owners of rental properties are in the same position.Hooray!

I agree that the system is completely broken, but the harm to the system is contained within H1-B system only. Thanks to the country limit, the GC immigration system is not broken yet for all other nationals.If America wants diversity in immigration, then the country limit is doing its work perfectly as was designed.I dont agree with you that US system is subjecting indians - this is manipulation. You failed to mention that fact that there is entire industry of bringing Indian engineers into US from Hyderabad and cities like that via student visas, H1-B, and then GC. It is this system that is flooding the immigration with H1-B and then GCs that put family immigration and other category GCs in a very long backlog

This is why I don t get all the doom and gloom, and all the people saying the bailouts stimulus low interest rates are going to further wreck things.All of the actual value and technology that we ve built up as a society is still there, ready and waiting to kick back into gear. I don t see how moving some numbers around in the meantime is going to create a long lasting deleterious effect. I feel pretty confident that, once the engine starts back up again, things are gonna boom.Would love to understand why I m wrong, but this article just pointed out a bunch of statistics that are bad right now but didn t really seem to make an argument to back up its headline which I m going to call BS clickbait.

Now that has moved into the digital age.It does not whatsoever eliminate the point of copyright. I can t bootleg albums and sell them on the street.To answer your question, nothing would happen if more people downloaded movies and music for personal use. Lots of Canadians still buy music to support the artists, and still purchase DVDs. Movies still make a killing in theatres, and musicians still make most of their money on tour.

2018-01-26 22:04:19.000	Personally I am a bit on the fence about his arguments as these are complex phenomena, but it is not obvious to me how this is sophistry. Why do you think this is an example of him using fallacious arguments with the intention of deceiving sophistry ? I ll dig a bit more into why I don t think it is clear.This is one of a series of lectures where Jordan Peterson argue against the postmodernist and marxist tendency to define people by identity groups, and defining a oppressor oppressed hierarchy between those identity groups.The core goal of his argument is to show that this post-modernist thought pattern is similar to marxist thought patterns around identity groups and oppression. He argues that this thought pattern is oversimplified as a person can belong to countless different identity groups, and that identity groups themselves does not properly account for individual differences within the group.He argues that oppression hierarchies between identity groups are meaningless in describing individual circumstances because it is a univariant analysis that doesn t account for the complexity inherent in the problem.He argues that this thought pattern was is a catastrophe in all communist countries where it has been applied and has lead to deaths of millions of people. He also argues that this thought pattern suppress the very mechanisms of free expression and ideal of equal opportunity that has made the western culture successful.In the end he seems to suggest working hard for equality of opportunity instead of removing opportunity using identity group oppressor oppressed hierarchies.I would love to see a well-reasoned counter-argument to this viewpoint.

2012-11-15 15:15:39.000	Isn t that the big limitation in everything? Think about every massive online success, past and present. MySpace, for example, was not fundamentally different than how you could upload an HTML page to a server...though designing and maintaining links is obviously work beyond the average dedicated developer. And Facebook was not fundamentally different than MySpace, but its news feed eliminated the work of visiting every friend s profile to figure what happened today, which made it much more likely that you d be rewarded in the psychological sense for visiting facebook.com rather than myspace.com...And so forth. The password encryption schemes used as an industry standard are quite secure against a brute-force, random intruder. So social-engineering is a much more viable way to break-in...and why does Bob read his password over the phone to someone claiming to be from IT rather than take the time to verify the integrity of the transaction?...Laziness.

2014-09-28 13:57:05.000	I think that bashing bad code, bad practices and whatever lead to any security-critical bug and any bug whatsoever, for that matter , should happen. If there weren t rants, flame wars and insults in the free software movement, I guarantee it wouldn t have come near where it is today. It s a big part of what drives innovation in all spheres, not just this one the harsh and not-so-harsh, sure comments, the passive-aggressive forks, the rewritings, the heated discussions.But bashing a person for writing that code? Never. I can t say my views on software politics are aligned with Mr. Stallman s, and neither I can say I have given that much thought to them. But I have enormous respect for everyone who has contributed to free software and helped shape the world, even with the smallest contributions... And Mr. Stallman s are one of the biggest. Everyone in this area should have the deepest respect for the enormous amount of work this man has done, and given it all to the community. It s hard, if not impossible, to stumble upon an anticonformist such as Stallman, who honestly does not care about the superficial things we all, unfortunately, do. I guarantee he could ve leveraged everything he s done and been a multi-billionare by now. Instead he decided that the benefit the community can get from his work is far greater than the benefit he himself can get, so he did the only moral thing to do he gave it all for free. And look at the GNU project now, or the FSF. Magnificent stuff.Mistakes such as this one and a great majority of developers make dozens of these on a weekly basis , are probably the most idiotic reason to call out a person for incompetence or senility. It s ridiculous. It s completely unacceptable to now demonize a man such as RMS, if not for other reasons, then because none of us will probably ever come close to what he has done to change this world for the better.

Expect rejections and interviews to go badly initially. Working at a PhD lab doesn t really prepare you for the standard dev position interview process. Unless you have worked on something interesting that a company is interested in, you have to put in some interview prep work. Put in the hours in prep, it will pay off.If you made it into an Ivy League school, you can make it into any dev position you want. I can understand the self doubt and feelings of uncertainty you are experiencing, but the key is to refocus the mind on interview processes and prep. Good luck!

2021-09-01 12:32:13.000	The biggest thing stopping me from using other compile-to-Javascript languages is that almost none of them fully support async-await.Many of them have some support for async await but few can handle all cases such as async-await within try-catch and so on.Scala.js async-await is not part of the standard libary I think and has this limitation might support async-await but I find their JavaScript documentation so confusing non-existent I can t tell. But also, Kotlin is too similar to JavaScript already anyway. It doesn t have ML-style pattern matching for example.The Java-to-JavaScript and C -to-JavaScript compilers both are too underused as far as I can tell. The latter, Blazor, is too focused on ASP.NET for me to be able to understand if I could write it the way I write React apps.Elm, ReScript, and other ML Haskell-influenced languages are too niche even though I m a big Standard ML fan.I m not sure what else there is to look at.And I really don t want to go back to using promises and callbacks.

They are still learning the very basics of climbing, running, sliding, swinging, ...Most playgrounds are okay for 0 8 year-olds. It s older kids, especially teenagers, who get most bored on de-risked modern playgrounds, and either give up on them or start looking around for often quite stupid ways to make them riskier, e.g. a group of 6 kids climbing onto a swing intended for 1 kid thereby breaking it , riding their skateboards down the slide and almost running over the toddlers at the bottom , climbing up onto the roofs of buildings that weren t intended for climbing, throwing rocks at each-other, ...The playground near my house was re-done a few years ago, and the number of kids older than 10 has dropped dramatically. All of the toddlers are plenty happy with the new one, but it s a net loss for the city because there are many good playgrounds for kids under 8, and very few for older kids.Aside those rubber surfaces are very uncomfortable on bare feet any time the temperature is above 80 F. And often playground wood chips are full of extremely sharp corners My adult friend stepped on a wood chip which punctured both his shoe and his foot . Sand, dirt, grass, and even concrete are all much more pleasant.

2020-12-18 13:44:43.000	I built my home compute cluster out of four Odroid N2. These are 80 ARM based single board computers SBC s , similar to Raspberry Pi s. You can bridge the gap between high and low ends buy buying low end and scaling horizontally.The troublesome piece is, of course, the horizontal scaling. For a cluster of ARM CPUs to be worthwhile, you need a job that can be parallelized, but not so massively parallel that it already runs on a GPU.Even so, I think there s a lot of potential for these low end ARM devices. Ultimately, their impact on x86 could be the same as what x86 did to the previous generation of mini computers.

That s his prerogative, but it doesn t afford him much favors in the form of being a part of the community. People have the right not to support Thiel or organizations he is a part of. What do you suggest they do? Is it more fair to boycott YC and the companies they have invested in rather than to ask for the resignation of Thiel?

Jornada s had replaceable batteries and were far more configurable than today s devices. They still got tossed. As phones go, RAZRs are another example. Most are just laying in landfills today. The list goes on and on.The e-waste problem goes wayyy beyond replaceable batteries. Nowadays you can t even send outdated tech to developing nations. The Chinese keep a lot of those nations well supplied with affordable recent phones for instance.Tech improves, and no one wants the old stuff. That s the problem you have to solve to address the e-waste issue.

Yes, there are still people who drink destructively, but figures are way down compared to some decades ago before these restrictions. Moreover, the majority of the public is in favor of maintaining these restrictions instead of loosening them, so there hasn t been that backlash against a draconian state that you speak of. It is definitely possible for a large enough group of citizens to be so concerned about the harmful effects of something that they do not believe it should be left to the individual.Junk food, too, is the target of similar restrictions in several countries now. Also, playgrounds have been scaled down in the last couple of decades for safety reasons, and in the USA that wasn t due to draconian laws, it was due to fear of lawsuits.

I mean, 10 year old me did from a different publisher Epic Megagames , but they just sent the whole trilogy anyway.But overall yes, a lot of those folks got good at churning out games, and part of that was understanding the value of good tooling.The level editor used for Keen, called TEd Tile Editor was actually used for something like 30 different titles, both 2d and 2.5D, prettymuch up to the original Rise of the Triad..

Even Lisp hackers seem to have thought so in the 1970s.
2014-03-04 23:10:14.000	The jury s still out on coffee in aggregate. Caffeine is a stimulant, and generally speaking, it has a host of positive effects on your processing speed, alertness, etc. Coffee may even have long-term positive effects there, though the evidence is inconclusive. Additionally, it might be neuroprotective.There have been conflicting and sometimes contradictory reports on coffee s effects on cancer, cardiovascular disease, etc. Many studies suggest coffee has anticancer properties other studies suggest it promotes certain types of cancer. Same thing with arteriosclerosis.In terms of dependency, caffeine has been shown pretty conclusively to be habit-forming and dependence-forming. Almost anyone who s been a longtime coffee drinker and quits cold turkey will experience the side effects. But it s not clear whether coffee is doing you long-term harm, long-term good, or some combination of the two that nets out to being positive, negative, or neutral.For my part, I ve been drinking coffee every day since junior high. My stance is that it s been a net-positive in my life, regardless of what price I may pay later on. But that s one man s opinion. Not a scientific observation.Also worth noting coffee, marijuana, and alcoholic beverages are complex substances. There are active compounds in coffee other than caffeine. There are active compounds in alcoholic drinks other than ethanol. There are active compounds in weed other than THC. Studies that isolate the effects of any of these compounds aren t necessarily indicative of the effects of the substances themselves.

2011-12-30 18:27:05.000	I like these types of questions, but I ve never been given one. How did you respond?Here s my take My first inclination would be to think about all the gas stations in my neighborhood, and all of those I pass as I travel somewhere. The gas stations start to spread out the further from civilization I go, but I ve never gone more than a quarter to half a tank of gas before seeing another. I have a phobia about running out of gas in the middle of nowhere. But the difficult part it is thinking about how gas stations are set up. There is definitely a relationship between population density and gas station count. The less people, the less gas stations -- but conversely there seems to be a point where the population is so saturated SF proper that gas stations are scarce inside the city.But maybe I just think that because of the relative distances I m traveling. Inside the city I m walking and see less gas stations, but outside the city I m driving and covering a longer distance in the same amount of time and see more gas stations.Also, we seldom see huge lines at the gas stations which means they are plentiful enough to service all available commuting cars without significant queue. If there are just enough to service cars without a queue, maybe we can say this naively X number of people in the US. Three people per family, so X 3 Y number of cars. A lot of families have more than one car, I know If each gas station has an average of Z pumps and is utilized constantly at an average of W through the day, we need at least Y Z W gas stations to service everyone appropriately.

2019-12-25 22:54:52.000	I did not know about Poland to be occupied, but recall myself when Baltic countries Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania had similar fate for almost 50 years - everything related to Christmas was translated somehow to New Year and real christian celebration was effectively banned. I remember having strange remarks in school in mid-80ies when we had Santa Claus instead official DedMaroz in home secretly. Nothing serious anymore then. Next interesting time was in 90ies with re-independence, all it was converted back to very christian and churches were packed in Christmas eve. New Year was regarded as soviet thing for some time. Now we see some revival of more joyful new year celebrations and current agnostic president did not even go to the christmas mass. Which was small scandal but a sign of times also.

This means that 2,877 people signed up for the service in the time between my account being created and the page rendering?But the number hasn t gone up at all, so me and the other 2,877 people were I guess part of a huge surge of signups all within the same 100ms or so, and no one else has signed up since?This is quite confusing, and does not encourage trust.

2023-11-28 19:10:13.000	To combat your pessimism - I would point to podcasts. In general, these were distributed on free platforms. The content became profitable through sponsorships. That is, the content creator does a deal directly with a brand to include a spot within the content read out by the presenter.So, there is a clear and well-trodden path to monetization for content creators even on free distribution platforms. Of course, as anyone who watches enough YouTube knows content creators double-dip on commercial platforms by including sponsorships and getting a cut of AdSense - so there is still a major advantage to also publishing on YouTube. But for the sponsorship, the value of the deal is related to overall reach across all platforms. That might give incentive for creators to release on multiple platforms, as long as the main commercial platform doesn t enforce exclusivity.
2022-09-03 19:11:07.000	Compressing consecutive 1 s and 0 s was the first idea that popped into my head as well. Then when they started to talk about inserting into the 800,000th position my brain went What if they just reversed the array and stored some metadata as the type of array they re dealing with? It s funny that in the end Bitmaps essentially are a modified data structure and process.The way things are going, I imagine someone will at some point take all the different tricks we have of inserting, sorting, finding, deleting data, take millions of datasets and run some machine learning type process to create libraries that can perform these operations optimally.

2011-05-05 14:01:58.000	In Australia every polling booth has party volunteers handing out How To Vote flyers showing how they recommend you distribute your preferences. So if you like the Greens but don t really know where those two obscure independents fit in to the picture, you d just follow their guidance on whether to put them at the top or the bottom of the list.I suspect most Australians probably just follow their preferred candidates preferences. of preferences is the mechanism that gives the smaller parties a say in the political process. The Greens say might know they have no chance of getting more than a couple of percent of the votes in a giving electorate, but they can do deals with the major parties based on that. e.g. If renewable energy becomes a campaign promise, we ll direct our supporters to put you as their second preference.

2013-12-29 06:26:12.000	Mistake number 1 not writing any tests.I was watching some anime last night where the characters were trying to make a computer game for some contest. They finished it, but it was too buggy to play through to the end without crashing or causing the computer to restart, not sure how they managed that one , and they decided it would be impossible to fix them all because the game takes five hours to play through all the way.This is a common error, not one committed at random by a bunch of fictional high school students. You should never need to use your program to check that it doesn t crash after you ve made changes. Your tests should cover this. If you re loading up your web browser to see if your sort routine works, you re wasting your time again and again. You have a computer that can be programmed to do anything you want. Tell it to do what you would do if you were playing your game or using your website. Then it can test your code thousands of times a second, instead of once every five hours.This is also a good check to see if your code is reusable. If you can t reuse parts in isolation to test your program, you re probably not going to be able to reuse them in another program.

I don t know of any. So, in these examples, the inner functions are closures, the outer ones are not, but only because the outer ones are used in a global scope. If you enclosed everything in another function, then also the outer functions would be closures.This is probably nitpicking, but in the examples on Stack Overflow, the outer functions don t close over locals of the parent scope. Their closure is thus empty, and I don t call these functions closures. Not sure if it is correct, though.

The interface is abstract in a way that makes it clear you have to interact with it in a special way respecting this context.On the other hand, the context of large language models is unknown. Should we consider everything in the training data as part of the context? What should I expect when asking chatGPT Tell me about when Christopher Columbus came to the US in 2015Should I expect a story of when Columbus came to the US in 2015, because that is the context I gave it? to be corrected by the AI because my factuals are wrong?OpenAIs example with this prompt is noticing that columbus is dead, but if he were to arrive what would happen.Further, the interface of large language models, asking things in natural language, leads us humas to interact with it as if it were a fellow human. This interface, and the examples we are usually shown, makes it easy to assume that it has a large context and we do not have to specify all constraints on something we expect other humas to pick up on based on the language used.

If you invest in hashpower, you can t split it without reducing your probability of success. It s an unforgable economic burden. Proof of stake architectures attempt to do the same thing with the currency of the network itself. There are lots of arguments about whether or not this is truly secure - but anyone on here telling you they know it s not is pretty much an idiot. There are tons of proof of stake coins operating successfully right now. There are no known attacks on these coins that allow you to do anything untoward if there were, they d be exploited on one of the many existing PoS coins .

Charging for them seems to specifically be an American thing and it isn t doing our country any good image-wise.I m guessing the reason isn t just profit, it s also to pay for the infrastructure to collect the carts and shuttle them through the terminals and back to their corral. Okay, fine, but tell me how this suppose to feel when a passenger actually decides to pay the fee? If they re arriving to the airport by taxi, they need to scuttle all their bags over to the corral, pay by credit card, slide out the cart, and then load it. And if someone s driven them to the airport their car is now idling at the entrance even longer, causing other arrivals to wait.You d think this would become a lawsuit at some point, or at the very least airlines would realize they could make even more profit with additional luggage fees.

2022-11-11 22:33:49.000	I ve worked places like that, and the issues are really threefold 1 There is often a substantial depth of knowledge missing. E.g. it s not that they don t know how chmod works, it s that they don t understand conceptual models of filesystem permissions and the implications of having overly broad permissions.2 The problem is often pervasive, where it isn t a single person that doesn t understand, it s a substantial but non-majority portion of the workforce.3 Employees often only stay in their role for a year or two, creating a revolving door of people who don t understand X or Y. Can they do the job they were hired for?It often depends on your definition of doing the job . chmod -R 777 will fix whatever issue is blocking the code from working, but is bad. And then someone else will use those permissions to build on top of that application, and it can spiral into a situation where it s incredibly hard to fix the bad permissions because of an unclear web of dependencies.The app works, but the architecture is fubar.

I built a Z80 based computer with 8KB RAM and 8KB ROM, programmed directly in Z80 assembler.I build the chassis from perspex and brass, turning my own spacers to hold the various boards in the right places. I used DC motors, made my own power controllers, opto-isolators, shaft encoders, IR wall distance detectors, servo steering assembly, bearings for the front wheel, ...Everything.Then the night before the competition I blew out my one and only EEPROM by plugging it into the programmer backwards.Never got to compete.But I still have Harvey 0 somewhere. I should pull him out and make a series of videos about his construction. But it was 35 years ago and the technology has changed ... I doubt anyone would be interested, especially because he never competed.But I was proud of building the computer from scratch and having it work first time, and of being able to run down my homebuilt section of corridor without hitting the walls. At the time no mice had run diagonally, so I really was in the running, provided it ran.Oh well. 0 No, not named after the cocktail 1 , but after the smallest species of mouse in the UK.

2020-06-13 08:31:38.000	Insulin is mostly in humans, not rats a hormone signalling energy availability. That s why many humans secret insulin when we smell or taste food, way before it hits GI tract. Maintaining the insulin glucagon cycle is important in maintenance of a healthy metabolism.No point in focusing on hormones so much. I somehow don t see people fretting over their ACTH or progesterone. Insulin mediates glucose transport and promotes absorption of blood glucose into the liver, fat and muscle cells.If you look at data from humans - insulin IS NOT needed for glucose absorption. Studies on diabetic people clearly show that glucose gradient into the cell is higher, not lower, despite them being incredibly insulin resistant. 1st role of insulin in humans that s critical is shutting down liver glucogenesis and gluconeogenesis.The problem with insulin glucose narration is omitting the role of FFA. Intracellular FFA levels drive down the glucose absorption gradient. If the glucose absorption gradient is low and we still have glucose - that will stimulate more insulin release to drive that glucose level to normal.Problem is that as more insulin is present cells eventually start being resistant to insulin requiring more insulin for the same job. Which makes for a problem because if insulin is there to shut down liver glucogenesis and cells are now more resistant to insulin - bad news, we need more insulin to get blood glucose to same levels with a meal that used to be no problem.Adipose tissue is simply the number 1 a-hole here because it s usually the least resistant to insulin and the least resistant to nutrient storage since it s its primary role. It will just pack more in.P.S. Isn t Fung a quack? E.g.

Akka s authors feel that continuing the status quo is unsustainable.Whether or not it s unsustainable because it s open source to some extent doesn t really matter perhaps with enough elbow grease on their part they could drum up more community maintainers and make it both sustainable and continuously open source, but that would require putting in yet more uncompensated work on the hope that it might lower their burdens at some point down the road, and come with the issue that more volunteers mean more work trying to coordinate everyone.Or they could just make it source available for the first 3 years and ask for money from the companies using it commercially there s also no guarantee that this will work, but money will solve more problems in the short term, so I can understand why they made the choice they did.

2017-08-23 01:18:32.000	Indeed. I m only running a 1080p projector so I was mostly looking for something that was cheap enough and had a very simple remote. That specific one looks great in that I can easily take a black marker and label the inputs 1 through 4 on the remote itself.
2023-06-24 19:25:38.000	Not necessarily No Score higher risk, higher interest.Incorrect low score perceived higher risk, higher interest rate.Depending on how the risks of no low score are weighted, and how wrong the inaccurate score is, a person may very well be more harmed by no score than by a low score. An inaccurate score might have to be massively off the mark to make a person worse off than no score at all. In the US for example, people with no credit history often get interest rates as high or higher than people with a relatively low credit score.Of course from a privacy data protection standpoint this doesn t make silently and secretly profiling customers okay. The solution is probably something more like a transparent opt-in system that has easy access for the customer to review their data and decide which pieces of it are included.In the US, the balance is skewed a bit more towards secrecy, and it s not opt-in either. However you can with only modest difficulty check your credit score information used to calculate it, and challenge parts of it that you think are inaccurate.
2020-10-13 11:09:43.000	That s a reasonable answer, but note that s it s a different answer from the OP - you re not proposing to ban intolerance per se, but rather any group whose purpose is solely intolerance.
2015-11-12 20:27:18.000	You re right, and that s how I ve always put the potential industry into perspective internally, but it would be suicide for cannabis producers to compare themselves to tobacco producers or by attempting to disrupt it . The perception of cannabis is that it s juvenile . The perception of tobacco is that it will kill you.
2018-03-29 18:37:05.000	I think he means that it s going so poorly that even a fanboy sub can t do anything but complain, which would be a pretty bad sign
2014-07-19 00:16:38.000	Sure. And don t get me wrong, I write a lot of bash scripts. I think any logic beyond string replacement is probably edging out of where it s a good idea, if only because other people then have to read my stuff later, but it s totally fine for that. I m saying more that I think Ruby or Perl make more sense than Python given the tools it provides.
2020-12-22 16:10:14.000	A military alliance of liberal democracies certainly makes sense. Mainly to counter China and Russia.Whether Turkey should be in NATO is hard to say without having a deep understanding of the situation. Turkey staying in NATO has pros and cons.
2013-10-31 22:11:47.000	One thing I find interesting is that it s somehow okay as long as it s directed at the foreigners . Who are these foreigners?Is it Sergey Brin or Larry Page, before they moved to the US? Elon Musk? Peter Thiel?Many Americans need not look further than their grandparents to see a foreigner and, excluding a few natives, the entire nation has been built by foreigners . Would it not makes sense to show the same courtesy for peoples privacy to people who weren t necessarily born here.
2024-01-03 01:31:40.000	The thing to understand is that the Squeak VM expects to encapsulate high level hardware including a bitmapped display, keyboard, mouse and a sound device.I understand this thing I really do and to develop those capabilities I would have to do it outside of Smalltalk with C and other tools in terminal but I really want to do it with and within Smalltalk learning it more as I go and that requires it starting without sound graphics in the first stage. This is the only choice available for me with my current limitations. I can temporarily run it to compile vm from source on other hardware but I cannot use it for longer work this way. I don t care really about the role I am putting myself in as long as I can study it more deeply by already using it and I am simply looking for easier way then implementing it from scratch and without Smalltalk because I only can work from terminal. I would agree that there are many interesting places for starting from scratch too and it would be interesting to see if you would point to them too but in my current situation I am really looking for the intermediate step I ve described. I simply have no other options for progress at the moment due to my limitations. In other moment I would imagine many other options and probably would not be that focused on one of them.
2016-11-02 21:31:11.000	See my edit, I said I think I agree with the premise the author was trying to rebute -- maybe it actually is a pipeline issue. Side note, I don t think this article is specifically about women, but underrepresented groups in general women, african americans, hispanics
2017-04-28 17:24:34.000	Of course, I suspect that s what he means, but I also suspect that what he sees as detrimental effects on women are actually not.But this is all a bit too abstract. Could you be specific of what these determintal effects are?Please not that any attempt to make up some egalitarian idealistic expectations without any regard to the biological reality is definitely going to have detrimental effects on both men and women.For example, if you try to push the idea that women, all women, should abandon the role of motherhood, because it s an oppressive societal expectation, and instead should chase after high paying careers, like the powerful men in society, then I think your idea if it was like this, or similar to this will have a detrimental effect on most women if it were to take hold in society .

2015-07-21 17:54:35.000	Some good points, but you refused to address my Bethe Ansatz comment cf. in any case, I recall Schwinger resigning from the APS over cold fusion. Doesn t make cold fusion right.Also I didn t realize the ground state of the Hubbard model wasn t mathematical physics? Spin liquids aren t mathematical physics? This is the same old story where people like des Cloizeaux and Pearson discovered bosonization and helped establish the long tradition of condensed matter people studying the Heisenberg model and making useful contributions to high energy physics and basically get ignoredIn the end my point is that you loved the idea of changing the world more than you loved physics. There s nothing wrong with that.

2018-04-23 08:04:04.000	Go didn t have any significant track record until glide came. But it still doesn t have a central repository so every update check means querying all the individual repositories, chokes sometimes on hg repositories, takes tens of seconds even with a few dependencies...I also don t like how all people became X developers . We are software developers. I don t think anyone who can code JS would have difficulty switching to Go or vice versa unless you are a mostly non-technical person, probably from marketing, who learned just enough jQuery, something which I also respect - I never learned just-enough marketing .
2024-05-18 20:35:14.000	I am not too knowledgeable about black hole physics, but it was my understanding that there s nothing locally interesting about event horizon it s just the point of no return that doesn t change much for the local observer. Your definition of the event horizon make it sound more locally important.In fact, I know that as a local observer falling into a black hole you can still see some of the outside world after falling into the event horizon by looking behind you , you just can t send anything back. This also seem to contradict the statement that all paths point inside or I may misunderstanding something .Edit again I did some research and it looks like that while parent s comment may be true for simplified model of a black hole, it is conjured to be possible for rotating black holes where you can stay inside. Also Google penrose diagram kerr black hole for some weird physic if you want to follow this rabbit hole. Keep in mind that I m not a physicist and this is my understanding after 40 minutes of watching YouTube and Wikipedia.

This left a huge gap in between the seats, so that merely by looking straight ahead and turning my eyes slightly to one side I could see almost all of his laptop screen. The author of this article is obviously lying, because if his seat was up and his neighbor s was back there would be no way to see his screen from behind. The author obviously didn t think this through well enough.
2021-10-08 22:10:23.000	Anyone else love the look of DOS GUIs?I do. Brings back memories of Turbo-C. It would be cool if there were a CSS framework where you could make webpages like that.A quick search brought this old project tried that, however. Ncurses is what is used under Linux and other UNIX like systems to draw terminal based GUIs, and allows some pretty good graphics.
2015-01-07 23:00:19.000	My biggest issue with the recent additions to the language is that there s now a thousand different ways to do the same thingTo be fair though, this has been an issue with Javascript since its creation and has been getting worse as the language has been expanded while maintaining backwards-compatibility .Many other languages have similar problems Ruby is an offender that comes to mind, though it s perhaps not on the level of ES6 I m not much of a polyglot, but one language which seems to have one obvious way as part of its design choices that springs to mind is Python. I have a hunch that pure-functional languages would be less choicy as well, though I have no familiarity with any.
2020-12-04 06:00:02.000	That s exactly why the proposed legislation is so problematic. It harms folks and offers no recourse... other than breaking the law. Then some of the innocent victims of the harm become criminals because they prefer that to suffering the harm at no fault of their own, and you introduce all of the problems inherent in black markets.I have yet to hear a solid argument for why it should be in all circumstances be regulated like investment securities even when only being used as currency like cash .
2022-06-16 17:46:37.000	Thanks! And yeah! It sounds super unnatural when even the tiniest pauses are cut out. Obvs I can t prevent anyone from using it that way, but I set the defaults to leave a good 1 2 second of space on either side of each cut, and to leave in any silent chunks that are around 1 2sec or so.Personally I think of the silence as a heuristic - it s the gap between re-takes, so if I cut at those points and then delete the bad takes, it saves a ton of time.This makes me think an interesting workflow to support might be something like, set the settings tight to get all the cuts, then delete the bad takes, then bring the pauses back.

2021-12-08 11:32:14.000	Rust is a mess. This effort will just result in yet-another zero cost abstraction where the real cost is developer time and sanity.Rust governance seems to have become Lord Of The Flies...and I don t think the author of this piece is holding the Conch. At least C has a standard that everyone accepts even if they disagree with it.Unfortunately the Rust hype machine is so overwhelming that many orgs will be forced to waste months trying to adopt it just to satisfy one alpha dev who fell for it and suddenly believes system memory is more expensive than developer time.It is serious and risky work saying no to devs who want to rewrite everything in Rust, but you have to be braveRust is not the future. The future will indeed be garbage-collected, and the true innovation will be to optimize GC runtimes to make them useful in more and more scenarios.
2011-08-05 18:39:00.000	1 The same people will hate you for using a white name on Google . Either you use your nonwhite name despite the disadvantage, in the hope that enough people using nonwhite names will normalize them and remove said disadvantage. Or you use a white name because you don t feel like fighting that battle which yes, will make you a collaborator in some people s eyes . You can t really do both. Although we re really talking about English sounding names here, since Polish people are hardly nonwhite . 2 Parents have a lot of control over our lives - sad but true. For example someone with crazy cult-following parents is more likely to end up in a crazy cult. Or for a more mundane example, someone with rich parents is less likely to be saddled with student loans. The European approach to this inequality is to make education free, but try do that in the USA! I don t think you re forced to use a nickname that isn t your legal name though.3 Sure, a signed affidavit should be just as valid as a court order - I can t imagine a social networking site would actually bother to check either.

However, in practice I m confident the vast majority of Mastodon and Twitter users including myself don t consider using either service particularly important or deserving of more than a couple minutes of thought. From Mastodon, I aim to follow some interesting users to find interesting articles, learn new things, get a sense of what s happening in the circles I follow, and broadly be entertained for a few minutes at a time. I absolutely don t consider it a critical component of my life and can t justify spending much thought on it.

I want something basic with OSX images - an OS X just for work, and OS X just for finances, and OS X just for music work, etc. As it is I have multiple user accounts for different clients - I get some isolation that way but things still get in the way in a few ways.

If the entity running the website or handling the data is outside of EU jurisdiction then they can take all of your data and there would be no repercussions for them.

2017-09-11 13:59:35.000	We don t need a coherent national identification system. We don t have a global one, the EU doesn t have one, why does the US need one?Centralized identification is bad. There exists no competent, accountable, trustworthy party to administer it. It inherently gets abused to aggregate information about people that should be private. Monolithic systems are slow to adapt, allowing attackers to continuously outflank them.When a bank needs to identify you, let them use your bank account number. When a doctor needs to identify you, let them use your patient ID number. And never the two shall meet.
2013-06-22 15:56:42.000	Variations on the theme of have them do a paid project for you surface here every so often. The problem is that a large number of job seekers currently have a job everyone keeps telling them it is easier to get a job while you have a job . Even qualified, competent programmers will find it hard to accept the risk of being dropped at the conclusion of the short project and if you no-one ever gets dropped, what is the point of the project besides giving you a warm and fuzzy? Fact is, you have to do everything up to that mini project then just go with your gut and hire no hire. If they underperform in the role you need to either change the role, try and train them up or let them go.This trial period is just a way of pushing the risk of a bad hiring decision back onto the candidate and allowing the manager to avoid the discomfort of actually firing someone although telling the candidate that the project didn t work out is functionally the same thing .

2022-07-07 14:49:02.000	Let me restate this how I view what you ve stated your position is that because Facebook has a Terms of Service that may define something that is not illegal - means that one must abide by it? Also... Facebook Meta Zuckerberg have lied over and over and over very publicly to get their way or to give themselves an advantage by giving themselves unfettered and unwarranted access to data that they profit from by their own fast and loose rules.If Facebook Meta Zuckerberg are OK with lying, stealing and cheating - then why should anyone leveraging their online properties need to abide? Until they re held accountable under broader rules I see no reason the consumption side can t bend them as well. And you may argue this isn t how it works but we all know this isn t how Facebook Meta Zuckerberg operate. They operate under the premise of do whatever makes us money because breaking the rules is the cost of doing business. So, no - they don t get to spew propaganda to the advantage of their business under the guise of protecting users. That is complete and utter bullshit.

Ramen is the same, with plenty of fancy places if you want that type of meal, but the majority are small, quick, almost fast food type places with cheap food.

Having Biden in the White House is as good as Trump or anyone else in their organization. Obviously Schiff and Nadler pledged their allegiance to the organization by raping boys on the record, with their task being to drag out an impeachment designed to obstruct and delay any real efforts to remove the President, thus keeping Trump in power. The witness blocking was to cause an apparent uproar delaying things with legal actions until late Summer. Soon after, the President would resign, leaving any other candidate with not enough time or support to compete with an opportunistic Biden, who is as good as Trump or any other Illuminati friendly politician in the Presidency.172 page PDF last update March 3 2O2O reported Wag The Dog first was feigned impeachment hearings meant to obstruct, now an attack on Iranians in Iraq.

Even with the insurance which changed half way through employment things like my migraine medication was still 150 mo on top of that before the change it was not much .This was actually much better than the job before that because at least the company paid for my coverage may be confusing but that s still 800 mo out of my pocket to cover my family .So yes, just the job you choose can be rather drastic changes in take home pay due to insurance coverage, so a huge impact on what companies you decide to work for.You can imagine the headache each year when it comes time to have to choose insurance plans again.

If what my buddies tell me of Apple s internal assesment of countries is correct, no other countries are even close to a 2nd place alternative on that, except for Taiwan, which is their plan C a sure to work, but expensive option if everything else fails.That s actually kind of what I meant by there s no plan B. They may be able to formulate other plans B, C, D, etc. and even spend a little money on them, but Western business-thinking won t let them actually deviate from plan A.One of China s advantages is that the West puts business in the driver s seat in a lot of situations, but business is short-sighted, selfish, and geopolitically naive, so it is exploitable and controllable with the right methods.

Something like software process champion or the subdivision head of software. Hopefully there are knowledgeable people internally that could fill that type of role.I think the most important thing as a leader is creating a network of advisors to give you thoughtful advice, and then being able to weigh the options and even synthesize your own. There are plenty of consultants and research groups Gartner etc that can also be helpful in large-scale transformations.

People would and have forgiven many other things, just for the utility of that as the presentation layer.I certainly would have picked up whatever language the browsers were pushing, where DOM access was a requirement.Conversely, I remember trying to get java applets to interact with HTML -- you have to message things through a tiny hole to from javascript which was one of the many things which made everyone hate java applets.

For example if all X pollinators go extinct, could it not potentially leave room for Y pollinatorsNot. We would enter in an extinction vortex. Less pollinators mean less seeds, less plants, and the empty space would be filled by Y, the species that Y pollinators search for. X would disappear. And we would lose Z, M and Q also. Is the same that happens with companies that lose their main customers. They became less attractive, not more.

Nothing else.

2020-10-26 00:43:03.000	And the breaches will still happen, because most of the compliance requirements will be in the nature of having to install antivirus on your Linux servers and mandating passwords to be changed often enough that everybody writes them on a sticky note on the side of their monitor and the password reset mechanism becomes easy to use with the obvious implications of that.I ll note that the whole password on a sticky note example is not ideal, but doesn t weaken such systems against what is likely the biggest risk they face network systems being compromised remotely.This is of course not ideal, but a far cry better than not having such policies in place.
2021-06-28 03:17:15.000	The questions considerations you ask are all valid, and are generally included in the buyer s evaluation process. Every point is extremely subjective and not precisely knowable. That s part of the fun of business!But you are obviously correct that there are no risk-free transactions. It might even be cheaper incorporating risk to build a 500 month business than to verify the purchase of one.Here I want to point out that I know a number of talented people who want to launch a business, but for whatever reason cannot get to the launched, accepting money phase of their projects. These people have no problem improving an existing business, but have trouble going from 0 to 1. I believe this population is as much as 100x the population of people who have successfully launched gotten revenue in an app. For these people, it might be entirely worth knowingly overpaying for a working SaaS because it gets them past the launch phase. Putting it bluntly, would they rather spend 10k on an app with revenue that you can grow or another 50k of nights and weekends over the year with no launch to show for it?Edit I also forgot that there s the entire category of buyers who just want to keep the app as-is and either integrate it into a bigger suite, use its traffic for lead gen, or otherwise leverage it for some other purpose. If the buyer considers the purchase as part of its marketing budget, 5k is not very much at all. Plus the bar is low as most marketing spend is wasted, see the adage.

There were public tours and a restaurant for the first 15 years.Yet disclosing its location would still have caused you to run foul of the Official Secrets Act for years.The UK government and courts has very little sense of humour about these things and you most certainly can not in general assume that making information public even in the most blatant manner will mean that they won t still insist that the information is still legally restricted as if it is still a secret.

For instance, if Kuwait doubles its productivity, oil imports to the U.S. will be much cheaper. But my point still stands that this is not also the case. Increased productivity from other countries can be positive or negative to America, depending on the specific situation.

And if this were any kind of world where doctors overrule you because your argument is invalid then she will of course not be forthcoming with her doctor ever. She will instead learn the magic words oh, Johnny had a bad reaction to a vaccine at his previous doctor in Canada. The doctor s office is not a courtroom or an arrest where everything you say can and should be used against you.I m reminded of people who think it would be awesome to bug lawyer s offices or doctor s offices or confessionals to ferret out crime. It will work the first time, but after that you have totally destroyed trust so you haven t gained yourself anything and the public has lost a place to sensitive discuss issues with people they trust.

2020-05-23 15:40:30.000	A friend who relocated to Japan mentioned this to me a few weeks ago. I was surprised that I had heard nothing about this in western media, since it seemed like the media was latching on to anything that might offer some hope of treatment or mitigation.The NY Times did run this article on it in early April. From that article This vaccine has saved as many lives as the polio vaccine it s an amazing story, said Dr. Curtis, who designed and launched the B.C.G. trial in Melbourne in less than a month, hoping to stay one step ahead of the coronavirus s spread in Australia.While he described the B.C.G. vaccine as underappreciated, he emphasized that it was not a specific Covid-19 vaccine. B.C.G. also cannot be administered to anyone who has a compromised immune system, because it is a live-attenuated vaccine meaning it contains live but weakened TB.Dr. Faustman said it should not be used in hospitalized patients with active disease, because it may not work fast enough and could interact poorly with other treatments.Not everyone is convinced B.C.G. holds much promise. Dr. Domenico Accili, an endocrinologist at Columbia University, said he thought efforts to use the vaccine against the coronavirus sound a bit like magical thinking. While acknowledging that B.C.G. is a non-specific booster of the immune system, he said, we should be able to deploy a more tailored approach. admit I reflexively dismissed it as wishful thinking that would disappear under closer scientific scrutiny. I don t know that that has happened. But it does appear, based on responses here, that there are other bigger social factors at play in Japan s success, if that word is even appropriate at this point.Outside the odd reference here or there like yours, I still haven t organically come across any big articles on BCG in my usual Western sources which includes wide-ranging outlets like HN, Twitter, and r Coronavirus . I am a NY Times subscriber, but that one slipped by me when it was published.

2021-10-31 00:49:42.000	The biggest mistake was making it trivial to forge email headers.While the spam problem is much better than it used to be, that s because there s a whole lot of behind-the-scenes and expensive infrastructure devoted to combating it.That infrastructure has also made it considerably more difficult to run your own mail server. While you can still do it, there are many hoops to jump through if you want to keep your mail from being dropped on the floor by the first overzealous spam filter it encounters. Unless you re big enough to devote a staff just to that or you have a lot of free time it s easier but more expensive to just use MailGun, MailChimp, or one of their brethren.I would guess that the annual cost of spam is somewhere in the billions.

Once you re there it s an apples-to-oranges comparison for the kind of startups that are typical for HN-types certainly no early stage startup is going to hire a 10-year manager to be employee 1 when what they really need is a hotshot programmer.
2023-08-02 18:14:57.000	One of the issues with Autism is a total refusal to eat certain healthy foods. The argument for a pill, or better, gut flora transplant, would be for people unable to make informed decisions for themselves. Once the flora were in place, theoretically, repulsion of healthy food would be reduced, allowing the child to feed his gut naturally, and hopefully improve mental health over time. This would be the holy grail, I hope more research is done in this area.
2012-02-24 22:02:33.000	Bose needs more love.I have a pair of their older on-ear model replaced by the OE1 . At the time, they were the most readily available pair of head phones where the main cable separated from the head phones. Most of my headphone failures over the years were from the stress at the device end of the cable. I have fixed this a few times but it s easier to get a replacement cable. So for the 199 I spent on the Bose, these are the best value for money head phones I have so far.Also they are more portable than most head phones, pretty comfortable, and they use a single cable rather than a y-cable.

I joked to myself I was a robot since it was incredibly consistent for decades.I would often go entire days without eating. My family says as a kid or teen I would always cover my food with a napkin to hide what I had not eaten. Even as an adult I would rarely eat a fast food combo there would be half the burger and fries left over. I ate what I need even pop and chips but I ate a bit and when I wasn t hungry I stopped.In my mid 40s I felt lethargic bad and my face was puffy. Stranger still I was gaining weight and eating more than I ever did. I d eat when I wasn t hungry which was a bizarre feeling. At the worst I was 190lbs the heaviest in my life. I was not a coffee or tea drinker but I got into energy drinks they made me feel normal.I went to the doctor and found out it was my thyroid I had hypothyroidism under active . My Dad had it and now I did rare for men hypothyroidism more common in middle-aged women. My first synthroid pill felt like I d drank ten energy drinks my skin was warm I felt clear of thought. But now it s stabilized and I think I m on the downward slide again.

2020-08-21 21:46:09.000	A question for Jeremy, perhaps. For the longest time the fast.ai courses have used Adam and one-cycle, at least for CV tasks. More recently Ranger and flat-cos have been dominating the Imagenette leaderboards. I guess I m curious if fast.ai intends to switch over to teaching that policy instead of one-cycle?I guess more generally I m curious what criteria the fast.ai team uses for deciding what techniques to teach. My feeling is that the courses have always taught the training techniques that are a healthy mix of SOTA, generally applicable, and easy to use.Ranger flat-cos has seemed like a really robust combo, and easy to use. So yeah, just interested in whatever internal discussions fast.ai may have had about it and other potential replacements for Adam one-cycle.

Maybe the proprietary nonsense I could dig in and waste my time on the issue tracker, but I m not the mega corp with a money printer.Microsoft has many low quality teams, especially in some of their dev tooling. The natural consequence is that it s primarily tested on Windows, and has evolved many failure edge cases on other platforms.The proper conclusion is - c is for windows, just how it s always been. Using it is selling the business s products to Microsoft and forever ties it to their endless tech debt.
2020-02-11 19:44:47.000	Understandably there s a lot of anger directed against the police and administrators that censored Dr Li. Of course they will be convicted of corruption or misconduct or something, but that just makes them victims too. They were doing their jobs exactly the way they were trained and incentivised to do it. I m not justifying them, actively supporting a corrupt system is a corrupt thing to do, but them being punished by the system they worked for is bullshit.I just hope Chinese people realise that the censorship of their protests about this is exactly the same as the censorship of Dr Li. It s the same system run by the same people for the same reasons.It s crap like this that the HK protesters are trying to keep out of HK. Most Chinese mainlanders swallowed the party line about HK. I hope this gives them cause to reconsider that attitude.

2012-05-12 03:13:57.000	Personally, I like the VM technique over compilation to JS source. With a VM, you can track the continuation by simple stack operations rather than furiously allocating JS closures. Think about the effect in memory when you do a return in a VM, you just pop some stuff off the stack s and there is no closure left hanging around for the GC to collect.The Dybvig Three implementations of scheme paper presents a really nice VM and Norvig s PAIP book presents a nice simple compiler for Scheme. Those are the two main sources that I ve used for my simple compiler.Edit Also... I lose all the benefits of JIT-ed Javascript if I run it in a VM.But if you are using CPS, then your JS functions are going to be really small and the JIT won t have much to work with, right? It s not clear to me that the JIT will be more effective working on CPS JS given that you want to have fine-grained continuations for debugging.

There are stats on the mortality rates, and given you are younger than 50 there is a less than 0.4 mortality rate.Furthermore, recent autopsies have shown this is a virus that hits the lungs more than anything else. China with it s incredible pollution, might have skewed mortality rates that are higher than we may expect in Europe US.Yes, we should do all we can to prevent the spread.

2017-11-09 02:29:01.000	Trajectories help. Some atoms travel together, others don t. And they go different places. Families on public transit are localized, and get on off together. Cars are mixed together on the road, but with tracking data, you can tell the taxis from the commuters. And trajectory paths can be simplified, and described in aggregate average time to reach X .Conformation spaces help. A thing changes shape, but the shapes are drawn from a family of likely possibilities. Your arm is likely to remain attached to your shoulder, and is less often raised up than not. Even in a tangled rugby ruck.Some things are ambiguous, but others not. Youtube had a nice ab initio molecular dynamics simulation of water which I ve been unable to find again . As a H proton wanders, sometimes it seems bound to a particular water, and other times, there s more of an area effect involving several. But a water molecule s nuclei generally stick with each other.The usual electron-density isosurface depictions have disadvantages. Picture traffic cones, say arranged in a tight grid. They have a peak, and their rims touch. Like the electron densities of atoms. But visually it isn t a problem. So replace the isosurface with a cloud, or just turn down the surface threshold, and the view is as empty as you want it to be. An electrostatic suspension of tiny flecks of neutron-star-like material floating in fluff.With eye tracking and XR, one might play games of visual selection. Show a 3D mess of proteins, clearly rendering one protein deep inside, but leaving enough visual clues of the others, to serve a focus targets. When your eyes shift target, change which protein is rendered clearly. Or do more with that selection, like showing trajectory, or showing other proteins too, related by type or process or history. You might see a 3D gestalt.The HCI of XR will be great fun.Aside Thanks for the youtube cytoplasm link.

There s a guideline section in the app where designers create a color palette, define all the colors that they ll be using. This way, when you re looking at the designs, you can instantly see if there s a color that is not defined in the palette.We ve heard back from a lot of designers using Zeplin saying that they re now more cautious about which colors they use. We re now working on a similar feature for reusable UI components.
2020-11-19 17:20:28.000	It s important to note that the financial regulation we have does not exist to regulate positive-EV games, it exists to regulate away outright scams. Not things where the principals are taking too many risks or where there are unknowables that sink the idea, but situations where the plan from the start is to attract investment, take it, and run away. Elisabeth Holmes-style fake it til you make it is sort of in the middle here. The part that is hard is that it s really very hard to do prevent outright scams without a lot of collateral damage. In general, scam artists are better at understanding and applying any rules than the regulators or the police. Successful ones are also better at marketing their scams to ordinary people than non-scam-artists are at marketing their real business proposals. After all, a successful scam artist only needs to have skills about marketing their proposal, but a team that is building something real has to have those skills and skills that are useful for building something real. Much like we know from history that bad money drives out the good, we also have overwhelming historical evidence that in a completely unregulated market, the scams and the amount of money they attract will massively overwhelm actual business. The regulations around the financial markets are scam-driven , in the same way that FAA regulations are funeral-driven . Every line of text exists because someone somewhere managed to steal so much money from so many people, that the victims managed to complain enough about how this shouldn t be possible that it became law. The natural progression of rules in both cases is towards less regulation, as everyone is perfectly aware that the regulation that exists is stifling and damaging, so over time the regulations are reduced and enforcement becomes more lax, until something like 737MAX or Madoff happens and regulations need to be tightened again.There is no chance that anyone will ever strike all these regulations down with enough funding and the right judges , simply because anyone who understands the space understands that while the regulation we have is bad, the alternative is so, so much worse.

HSR won t really stop anyone from driving, except to the airport On the other hand, it seems incredible that an HSR could terminate anywhere near the urban centers of Los Angeles, San Jose, or San Francisco. Yes, these areas have some of the most feared NIMBYs and BANANAs on the planet but are just plain crowded and would require that a huge number of residences, businesses and existing infrastructure be relocated. This last is a big reason why HSR is almost impossible in the US East -- after what happened with Route 93 in Boston you just can t build an urban highway anywhere in the U.S., even with a population that perceives highways as benefiting people like themselves.

It s good to have a goal, it s good to have things you can check to see how far along you are, but you need to map out what must be done to achieve forward progress also. A lot of companies confuse the journey for the destination and set OKRs without mapping out how that may be done. Or maybe they leave the how to lower levels, who I guess set OKRs of their own and delegate the how to their subordinates, etc.? I dunno.

2021-10-12 17:57:51.000	Censorship exists, but that is not at all the same thing as forcing people to have a certain opinion.This Harvard paper explains that, instead, censorship s role is to silence movements. Pro-government posts are censored when they have the potential to go viral. Anti-government posts that don t go viral, aren t censored. How Censorship in China Allows Government Criticism but Silences Collective Expression censorship exists simultaneously with government responsiveness. That is, they actively monitor social media for grievances and they actively address these grievances as in actually addressing, not arresting people for arresting . Nowadays social media is one of the major channels for government feedback. New law proposals are regularly formed based on mass complaints on social media which may or may not also end up getting censored . This is a relatively new thing, developed in the past 15 years or so.Punishments are not that common. You d have to reach Julian Assange level for that to happen. Censoring without any further consequences is the norm.

Privacy is fast becoming a thing of the past if you let anything with sensors onto the premises, and short of wrapping their home or office in a Faraday cage, there is disturbingly little anyone can do about it as more manufacturers reach agreements with network providers to handle their phone-home data needs.

Before you argue otherwise, the complexity and proprietary nature only arises when you try to show preference to less desirable content before other content information consumers desire. Ie - advertisingEven with advertising in the mix, it is trivial for a search company to append a query score with its query results.

They didn t find any except for their own test images . But it presumably continues to be a channel people check.Wouldn t encrypting the data to be hidden, and then hiding it within random data say, the low bits of image bytes be perfectly indetectable? I m assuming that the low bits of image bytes are uniformly random, but even if they re not then one could still hide data in them, it s just trickier.

If you re just gluing third party components and libraries together you re going to end up with a bloated mess.This is why javascript front-end developers get so much flak - there is a prevailing opinion that you can just fake it and not bother to learn best practices, not bother to test, and not bother to care about performance. If you do not consistently produce work of professional quality you just might not be a professional.

Even if TCG remains relatively basic, 2x better code generation then QEMU is still a strong claim.I suspect that the reason why blink is faster in this experiment is not related to code generation, as I mentioned in another comment. Looking again at the screenshot, the 28 context switches vs 0 for blink might be a clue as well.

A pro tip I picked up from Gary Bernhardt s Destroy All Software screencasts is to leave some DRYing or other refactoring for readability maintenance purposes until after you write tests and are in a red-green-refactor cycle. You can always DRY your code later, especially now that IDEs make it so easy to extract methods for you with automatic population of required variables parameters.

There are shortcomings, obviously, in each measure or simplified model of every reality. For example old certificates lose informative value. That s why, for example, language certificated such as TOEFL are only valid for some time. There are other certificates, though, that probably have an expiration date for business purposes e.g. GMAT is valid for 5 years, but it basically measures general IQ and analytic capabilities, which shouldn t change a lot in five years, IMHO .
2024-10-05 02:17:09.000	We use Kafka under the hood. We stream instead of poll. We used to work at the Kafka team in AWS Our thesis is that a big blocker is the PhD the whole team needs in Kafka. For example, if you want to set up an API similar to Ambar with tools like Kafka connect, the connectors have failure modes that will bite you once a year and bite you hard. Eg losing your changelog in MySQL, and having to start from scratch or risk losing ordering guarantees.

2022-02-15 18:34:07.000	Dead Internet Theory is totally believable. I remember back in 2006-7 or so, being slightly curious about putting up a food review site because I was really angry at my local X food establishment. I found places were you could buy complete restaurant database ready to be scripted onto the web for maybe 90 a pop. The data was actually pretty good, but I was shocked by the huge community around flipping these dbs into internet spam. For the very high majority these were hungry business types who could barely open a code editor without asking for help. I only expect the problem has gotten exponentially worse since then now that ai generated content has improved in quality.

2020-12-13 02:27:31.000	Personally, I do prefer working in the shell, but if you prefer working in a modern IDE, don t let anyone fool you that you re somehow wasting time or being less proficient than you could be in a shell I totally agree with that sentiment. ... unless your work entails working across multiple machines and environments daily That situation might be a lot more likely than you d think. I started out doing WordPress, and that s still what mostly what makes me money.But now that I am using 30-40 different machines that host 3-400 sites, each with their own installs, and knowing how to do stuff efficiently with the shell is super useful.To me, that situation feels kinda unlikely, but at the same time dang it s nice to just ssh into a machine and know what I m doing.I have coworkers and clients who just can t do certain kinds of tasks or troubleshoot stuff with certain kinds of tools because they just don t have the CLI knowledge.So while I generally agree with your post, I will offer an alternate idea to balance it if folks are thinking that learning how to use a shell is a waste of time because they can do everything in a GUI, if they took the time to learn the shell at a a level of most of the things they use every day in an IDE, they are not losing in efficiency at all and possibly making gains when it comes to certain tasks.

2018-04-25 11:21:47.000	From being asked this question in various forms many times, I ve found the answer is in the process, not my specific actions, which are tuned to my life and circumstances.The answer is that you start with what you can. Do. Act. Experience. Iterate. Learn. Same as with entrepreneurial and business success. The worst thing to do is analyze, plan, and point out how your case is special without acting.Listen to my podcast and you ll hear guest after guest taking on challenges, learning from the experience, and finding the next thing easier and more rewarding. You re not alone. then it becomes difficultWhen did I say it was easy for me? I don t see why you would think it was. For all you know, your case is easier than mine. It probably is.In any case, you get to the hard things by tackling the easy things, applying what you learned, and advancing. Feel the reward of getting something done and expect bigger reward for the next thing.You can t do difficult when you re hung up on easy. If you don t do easy because you think it s not worth it, you ll never get anywhere.

A mind boggling amount of infrastructure goes into separating the Shinkansen from the rest of the world. Hundreds of kilometers of it is raised up on bridges, the rest is inside tunnels or strongly fenced off by wire fences or concrete walls. No level crossings either.I imagine part of the design of the front of the trains is also to minimize damage by deflecting impacts. Although I think the major design drive for their long noses is entering and exiting tunnels without creating sonic booms and air pressure issues for passengers.

I ve scanned through the specs and I haven t seen any complexity just for the sake of it. Care to point out any specifics? Also note that some of the added complexity is to support new features, such as power provider consumer switching and power safety.As for the substandard Chinese grade products, they ve always done that and will continue to do it. Bulk of existing USB chargers you find have horrible ripples and have power factors that seem to have been engineered to be embarrassingly low.

2023-11-29 04:51:29.000	Most of the world is run without democratic control. I mean, I hate the CCP, but given that there is no other government that is going to be able to keep any part of China running, is it so wrong to say that overthrowing the CCP by assassinating key leaders is a rash decision? Perfect should not be the enemy of good enough. And what happened to give me liberty or give me death , you will not tread on me , no taxation without representation , and all of that stuff so popular in the US? Guess that doesn t apply to the Arab...Americans culturally would not tolerate any of that. I think it would be good for Gazans to fight Israel for its independence on proper terms. Perhaps that would lead to a proper state instead of this barbarity. At what point did the continental army decide to kidnap children and rape women instead of engaging the British directly?But like I said before, perfect should not be the enemy of good. I have traveled extensively. Americans have a very unique culture. Most people around the world value order, while Americans mainly value the ability to run their own affairs at the local level. The Gazans have shown no interest in American-style democracy. Fine.This is not hypocrisy. The flags say Don t tread on me , not don t tread on them .

2016-03-31 16:49:06.000	I absolutely agree with the general sentiment in this thread that we re all self-taught. I ve had quite a few friends ask me to help them become programmers, and my first response is that to paraphrase it s not just a job to learn and then work towards retirement. It s a constant learning experience where you have to wake up every day and realize you re ignorant, slow, and unimaginative compared to your peers and if that s not the case, then you re probably going to fall into obscurity. If you re ok with that, then let s get started. One avenue I haven t seen yet approached here is that schooling was far behind the times at least through the mid-90s. I was set to graduate from a highly regarded prep school in 1996, and in the advanced computer class , we were learning Pascal. My queries about the internet weren t answered well enough to keep me interested in the conversation.By then I d built a couple silly websites for myself, met hundreds of people from around the world, and had my own little secret educational source - a step up from my peers in school, which I needed because they were all Definitely smarter than me. I was hooked and had zero interest in plain old desktop applications, which was the end-game to what was being taught in every school I looked at from my 17-year-old perspective .A book on Perl understood what I was after. It wasn t even necessarily a very good book on Perl. It had an open source web-store on a CD in the cover and it told me step-by-step how to find a web host and then set up the web-store on a server. I set up a web store for my mom s retail business, which then stayed afloat for a little while longer she now sells online full-time .I proceeded to drop out of college and haven t stopped learning since.

They seem like they have a huge conflict of interest as it s a massive threat to their business model.If we had truly capable self-driving cars, we could probably get rid of 50 of all cars on the road. Most cars spend upwards of 90 of their existence parked and doing nothing, waiting for their owners to need them. If cars could be operating full-time 24 7, ready to be dispatched anywhere as needed, it would mean the destruction of vast amounts of transportation demand.

In lawsuits there are almost always financial incentives in play for either party, but this doesn t automatically make it lobbying. A common example of lobbying is company A wining and dining legislatures in order to seek favorable votes or provide input on new legislation. I disagree that the intent of the decision was to support the way biotech companies make money. The intent is to interpret the law and decide based on this interpretation. The interpretation given is that ...the compositions here are not natural products. They are the products of man, albeit following, as all materials do, laws of nature. I don t know nearly enough about genetics or molecular biology to form an opinion on whether this interpretation has merit. However, this interpretation is where arguments for or against the ruling should be founded on.

2021-02-14 15:19:43.000	Is this where there was a problem? But the retail trading platform takes zero financial risk as long as they don t allow their customers to trade on credit which is an entirely different issue .From matt levine This means that the seller takes two days of credit risk to the buyer. I see a stock trading at 400 on Monday, I push the button to buy it, I buy it from you at 400. On Tuesday the stock drops to 20. On Wednesday you show up with the stock that I bought on Monday, and you ask me for my 400. I am no longer super jazzed to give it to you. I might find a reason not to pay you. The reason might be that I m bankrupt, from buying all that stock for 400 on Monday. Generally if you buy a stock on Monday you still want it on Wednesday even if you don t, we live in a society, and you ll probably cough up the money anyway because that s what you re supposed to do. But at some level of volatility things break down. If a stock is really worth 400 on Monday and 20 on Wednesday, there is a risk that a lot of the people who bought it on Monday won t show up with cash on Wednesday. Something very bad happened to them between Monday and Wednesday some of them might not have made it. You need to make sure the collateral is sufficient to cover that risk. The more likely it is that a stock will go from 400 to 20, or 20 to 400 for that matter, the more collateral you need.

2023-01-09 06:19:12.000	Great suggestions. We ve experimented with a free student pass 1 4 our users are university students , but it hasn t had a huge impact. This might be because there s some friction involved.Our current focus is on revamping our freemium structure, so that instead of 2 weeks of unlimited usage and then extremely limited functionality thereafter, it would instead offer indefinite usage on a limited number of websites it s a browser plugin that enhances text to make it easier faster to read . Previously we ve not surprisingly seen a ton of uninstalls at 2 weeks, and with the new structure we re hoping to hang onto more users for the long haul. Some of them would eventually convert, and some would just continue to think about us and recommend to friends. But another side effect is we could increase the number of favorite sites that people get, up to some arbitrarily large number so it s effectively free unlimited usage.Interestingly, the development that got us to pull the trigger on this change is the manifest v3 transition, which required us to revamp a lot of stuff about our extension so we figured we d go for it. If this turns out to be a big plus for adoption, I guess we ll be thankful for being forced into the transition?

2015-09-01 00:36:25.000	I can recall anyone in a scene. I think it s a detailed image I can zoomed in, and I think I have all their details eyes, hair, eyebrows, etc down. It s a full color scene where the person of interest can be moving in their characteristic walking style, waving their arms the way they wave their arms, and talk the way they talk. However if I try to focus on the details, it s all a blur. It s like when you have a small 50px by 50px photo, and it looks sharp. Zoom in, and you realise it was an illusion. That s exactly it for me.I can imagine my girlfriend s foot a little more in detail, e.g. changes in skin tone, but I can t remember the shape of her individual nails. Some of the details of my girlfriend s, I can see in my mind, the others are mostly a blur. I can t see in detail what I haven t noticed in real life. The details I see are because there was a scene where she made a very appropriate facial expression in response to a situation and I remember that detail very clearly - like the way she smiled and tried to convince me everyone said she had a beautiful smile on our second date.Also - I notice the images I conjure in my mind are always a lot dimmer in brightness than when seeing images with my eye. I can remember them being bright, but I see them as dim - even when imagining the sun and the sky. It s like looking at a computer screen in bright sunlight.It still doesn t seem that vivid to some of the people described in the article.

Now it seems to be already routine.As someone who grew up in the 80s-90s, my historical sense of layoffs is that they were a response to economic hard times, whether industry-wide or company-specific. Companies laid off when profits fell or disappeared, which then drove a need to search for ways to cut costs.But the major tech companies are all seeing continuously growing revenues and profits within the context of very healthy general economic numbers, yet they are all laying people off.

2017-02-24 14:11:37.000	It seems that the main point of contention is whether migrants are more or less likely to commit crimes in Sweden . This article doesn t answer this question at all for us. The following is the one remotely relevant statistic People from foreign backgrounds are suspected of crimes more often than people from a Swedish background. According to the most recent study, people from foreign backgrounds are 2.5 times more likely to be suspected of crimes than people born in Sweden to Swedish-born parents.And even this isn t really what we re looking for because accusations ! convictions. One can easily postulate that foreigners would have higher chances of being falsely accused, and factors like this have to be accounted for in the analysis.The only factual evidence that we have to go on so far is otalp s reference to a study that showed German refugees are less likely to commit crimes than the average citizen.Sadly, in this kind of argument, facts rarely matter and will likely not change erroneous views.

2013-03-05 16:39:52.000	It s good that this worked for them, but I think it s a bit questionable to assume that because it worked in this case it s a good idea or even an idea at all instead of just a complete dismissal of planning and structure .There s a lot of different ideas about how much is too much in terms of up-front design, but to me this goes a little too far to be called anything but chaos with a chance happy ending.

2009-02-23 03:09:59.000	Wow, that s genius! Let me make sure I have you straight I ve never heard of this before ...You check the TicketStumbler blog for hot pre-sale tickets. You buy them for face value when they go on sale 10AM? hoping they ll get sold out. Then, you flip them on StubHub Craigslist after they re sold out? What if the show doesn t get sold out?Also, did I understand you correctly in that TicketMaster gives the best tickets to the first people who buy them, and you might get bad seats buying at 10AM? How can you tell if the seats are good enough?Thanks for the info
2014-03-04 23:44:08.000	Of all the speculative explanations so far, this one would make the best plot for a movie script.
2013-08-02 16:32:27.000	I m not so sure, really. If a reasonably well respected employer phoned in a tip about an employee looking up what they thought were terrorist-y things on a work computer we ll never know what they actually phoned in, I d love to know though! , I d have expected that to generate an investigation for quite some time now.The worst I can possibly think of to accuse the cops with in this case is showing up with too many people. One or two uniformed officers was all that was necessary.

2020-01-30 18:56:49.000	This is already true, and is not an uncommon situation. This is akin to saying half the population makes less than the mean income .But this is HN, so let s throw some numbers in to see how badly it s skewed already.The state with the lowest population-to-elector is Wyoming, with about 193,000 people per elector. The state with the highest is Florida with over 740,000 people per elector. So Wyomingans votes for president are over 3.8x more valuable than Floridians.The national average is around 580,000 people per elector, and Louisiana is pretty darn close, so I m going to omit them from calculations. That leaves about 217,000,000 people in states that are higher Georgia, California, Iowa, New York, Illinois, New Jersey, Washington, Maryland, Missouri, Oregon, Minnesota, Michigan, Wisconsin, Massachusetts, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Colorado, North Carolina, and Florida , and 106,000,000 people in states that are lower the others .I m too lazy to list out common political affiliations, but they re not as clearly biased as you d expect.

But it s ok because that group of posh muppets in the ERG stand to make a wad of cash from their crony mates and we re now a Sovereign nation. Which is excellent apart from the fact it s made up faux history bullshit from another era of great Britain that never actually existed and certainly doesn t exist in a globally transient world.The whole thing has been a very, very expensive, entirely farcical laughable if it wasn t going to royally bugger large swathes of the country exercise in nihilism.Bitter much?

Your current grants are only cheap and valuable if you expect the stock price to not only bounce back, but also go higher in the foreseeable future.

I d be a little baffled I suppose.I really love how the author complains about the other missing the bigger picture, when there s a bigger picture they themselves are oblivious to the ideas in your head are really awesome and all, but if you don t learn how to use language properly to communicate them then they re useless to everyone else.
2016-02-23 00:40:02.000	How difficult would it be for a startup to create two stock classes, where one has outsized voting rights?

2017-02-16 15:35:26.000	Good points. A couple of comments I wanted Strongtalk, and they gave us OcamlPithy, and there s some truth to that, but I would point out that a StrongTalk is now well over 20 years old b it has a sophisticated type-system that could certainly have been developed further and c it requires a JIT for performance.But Objective-C without the C does point very strongly in the direction of Smalltalk, and a Smalltalk language that can be AOT compiled roughly as efficiently as Objective-C and is at least as compatible with C Objective-C seems like not too much of a challenge.After all, Objective-C now has tagged pointer objects, so a lot of the need for primitive objects has gone away. So let all literals variables be objects by default and the syntactic overhead due to duplication goes away 1, 1, string, nsstring .What if we want C level primitives? Just type them aNumber aNumber aCInteger Pointers are tricker and should, IMHO, be generalized to 1st class references that subsume things like KVC KVO bindings, file references, URIs etc. see .So the point is not Objective-C forever , but rather let s actually learn from what was good and bad about Objective-C and base our language design on that, rather than coming completely from left field and then only putting in compatibility kludges.Then you wouldn t have the situation that we have now where people are clamoring for pure Swift versions of...well pretty much everything, and those things are, if pure Swift going to incompatible with what is there now. And more importantly, not build on the knowledge learnings of what is arguably the best UI framework ever built.
2018-12-28 22:55:40.000	I think the methodology is broken here. If we start to extend the notion of religion to be able to mark any world view as a religious one, than what a point to have a notion of a religion? With such a methodology religion becomes unfalsifiable by means of Popper, so it have zero value as an idea.In particular they tend to name any belief as a religious one. So if I believe in the power of progress, then I have a religious belief therefore I m religious. But not every belief is religious, some are very rational and based on evidence.What I cannot comprehend is why? Why people do it and for what reason? Why they want to believe that everyone bears religion? They want it so much that they are ready to turn inside out the notion of religion, which seems very important for them. They are ready to make the notion of religion to become meaningless this way. Why?I have a hypothesis for it. Those thinkers just know nothing about science, methodology and rationality, and they are making their best trying to wrap a very big and complex world into something they understand. It happens that they understand nothing but religion, so all the world for them becomes religious.
2024-07-01 08:59:57.000	A bunch of friends and I once toyed around with the idea of replacing microblogging through ActivityPub with one RSS feed per user. To then display them in one combined feed, I just added all of them to a category in my RSS reader, the way I already did with topics before. One of my friends RSS reader didn t have that option grouping by category yes but no combined feed so they instead combined the feeds into a single RSS feed and added that to their RSS reader. In the end it was kinda finicky so we went back to ActivityPub.

2014-09-12 19:39:37.000	There s a long history of mocking and decrying the file as a user-level concept, and many applications hide the concept from the user, even though they store user data in the filesystem. Music players such as iTunes are an example there are songs, albums, and artists, but files do not show up in the UI in any way. This is standard practice at the application layer. However, implementing something at the OS layer with the expectation of exposing it directly to the user goes against the current thinking that it s the application layer s job to provide user-friendly concepts, and that the job of the OS is merely to support the application layer in doing that.If providing support for application-level user-friendly abstractions is what you want to do, then I would suggest studying applications with UI abstractions that you admire and judging your OS storage layer by how well it supports application development.

The ability to precisely place a missile without any external navigation except for stars. Once it gets cheap enough, it ll probably go into cruise missiles it could eliminate or reduce the need for terrain contour matching, which requires radar transmission.I m not 100 certain but I believe when MEMS accelerometers first came out, the better ones were subject to arms controls because of fears they could be used in missiles.

But you could still have the situation where someone signs up for, let s say, Hulu with your standard jameshfisher gmail.com account. And then you could still end up paying if you forget whether you ever signed up for Hulu or not maybe you were about to sign up and didn t, maybe you planned to in the future .Email validation seems like the most important defense against this kind of thing.

2016-04-25 18:07:47.000	I wouldn t discount this possibility entirely. As recently as the late 90 s Russia defaulted on their own debt.The Russians defaulted on debt handed to them during the break-up of the USSR. This is an important distinction in the mind of the Russians it was not debt issued by Russia for Russia.Shortly before the default on the bonds, the Russians had apparently offered a swap for Russian bonds. Very few people took them up on it, but those who did suffered no write-down.For more reading, check out Martin Gilman s book No Precedent, No Plan Inside Russia s 1998 Default . It gives deep insight into the complexity of the Russian default.Which is all a sort-of aside on your comment, I appreciate. Many countries have gone bankrupt since WW2, at a background-rate of around 2 countries per year. I put together a map visualizing it at reality is that the semantics of default mean very different things in different contexts, but generally if the governing law of a debt instrument e.g. a bond is that of the country issuing the debt, then the country can legislate away their obligations. This may nevertheless have knock-on effects in marketplaces, particularly via contingent or derivative instruments e.g. credit-default swaps , and hurt the credit rating just much as if there was a technical default.Very few countries have the luxury of being able to legislate away their debts, and even those that do would feel a backlash and ongoing burden remaining in the marketplace.Note that being able to print ones own money and being able to change the law governing the instruments are two different things, though sometimes similar in effect. If you control the law you can change any term of the debt agreement by legislation, for example. If the debt is repaid in ones own currency, one can print currency to satisfy those obligations as in quantitative easing, or seigniorage .All to say The Russian example has an interesting caveat, but it is in any case one of many recent events illustrating defaults on debts which include Greece, Cyprus, Iceland, Argentina, Ecuador, Ukraine, and others .As you can probably tell, I could probably talk about this at some length.

Even if one builds clusters with true 100 reliability running on nuclear power buried 100 feet underground, you still have to talk to the rest of the world through a network which can fall apart for variety of reasons. If most of your users are on their mobile phones, they might not even notice outages.At some point adding an extra 9 to the service availability can no longer be justified for the associated cost.

2021-08-03 13:17:58.000	Kind of related I was the lead developer for Syncplicity s desktop client. It was a file synchronization product very similar to Dropbox.When I joined, the desktop client was 100 event-driven. The problem is that some kinds of operations need to be performed synchronously, so event-driven tended to obfuscate what needed to happen when. Translation For your primary use cases, it s much easier to follow code that calls functions in a well-defined order, instead of figuring out who s subscribed to what. Events are great for secondary use cases.To translate to microservices, for primary use cases, I d have the service that generates a result call directly into the next service. For secondary use cases, I d rely on events. Of course, there s tradeoffs everywhere, but you ll find that newcomers are able to more easily navigate your codebase when it s unambiguous what happens next.
2013-03-19 13:19:16.000	To be fair, those percentages I gave, I made up for that example. Though I d imagine they are something close to that. But it depends on the chip, the market and the company selling them.You design those percentage bands, generally to the size of the market you re aiming the chip tiers at. The silicon will be as good as they can get it generally, nobody wants to push bad products out. Recalls and returns probably cost more in the long term than failing more chips and suffering a worse yield.However if only 0.5 of your customer base is interested in paying more money for a faster chip, you only cream off the top 0.5 of chips.

I for one have accepted my EF LINQ overlords for the general sanity it provides to most queries.However, I don t touch any of the ORM features other than certain conveniences like .Include for trivially handling trivial joins, and most of the code ends up with an almost 1 1 translation to the actual SQL statement.Same with SQLAlchemy Core in python, though the expression API is distinctly less pleasant than LINQ.Anything that doesn t fit cleanly in LINQ usually ends up as a View or procedure in the DB anyways except for DELETE statements, which EF is uniquely awful with requiring the rows to be fetched first before turning around and actually deleting them

2019-09-14 11:54:43.000	This includes proc-related escapes as well as more general VFS attacks.Right, there are numerous ways to mess up a chroot, just like any other namespace isolation such as process and network namespaces.Basically as soon as you bind one namespace inside another, the containing namespace will have access to the contained namespace. That much should hopefully be obvious. If you mount a procfs inside your application it is no longer contained from the syscalls that procfs necessitates.But that s not typical for an application that drops privileges. Even decaces old software such as BIND, which has had numerous vulnerabilities over the years, chroots to the data directory and drops to an unprivileged user by default.There is an important distinction here whether the application itself should drop any unnecessary privileges, as exemplified by chroot, seccomp and pledge, or whether the application should be started with as little privileges as possible, as exemplified by SELinux and Docker. In the former case, the responsibility falls on the application developer, and in the latter case on the system administrator or end user.The article explicitly argues for SELinux instead of the chroot. That is, arguing the latter approach is superior to the former. That is experimentally verified bad advice by now.Software such as Chrome rely on chroot-style compartmentalisation and is much better off because of it. tools should have switched to using pivot_root 2 a decade agoYet people keep using the simpler tool. The threat model is the same and pivot_root is easier to misuse. In fact, it is probably a good idea to do both.
2021-05-18 00:50:00.000	You completely misinterpreted the statement. It was rather obvious to me that the person you were replying to was curious if there was any conflicts of interest that would cause someone to ignore a conclusion.Finding someone to blame as you say is not really the key issue. If you want to prevent this from happening again you might just possibly want to know where this virus came from.4 months after SARS 1 we knew the intermediate host was a civet. 9 months after MERS, we knew the intermediate host was a camel. As of now not a single intermediate zoonotic host has been identified.At this point the probability threshold has shifted towards a lab leak. We can acknowledge this fact or we can collectively acknowledge that maybe just maybe a research center with a quarter of a billion dollars in funding from the United States government for evolving Corona viruses from bats to infect humanized mice might have had something to do with the virus that broke out in the exact same city.I mean it really is absurd how quickly people dismiss this rather obvious fact.Figuring out where this virus came from is extremely relevant considering that the gain of function research that in all likelihood created it is going to be increased in funding as a result of the pandemic. If the public knew that the virus was almost certainly not a naturally transmitted one from a wild animal host, they probably wouldn t be on board with funding more of the research that created it.

You are dealing with the worst possible combinations of landscape and expense. My honest answer is you need a specialist with the proper testing equipment measure the resistance to earth at your location. If it is very high you will likely need deep holes dug reading about one mountain top location that needed 600 to get proper grounding, you shouldn t need anything that extreme . The combination of a chemical grounding system in a well shaft may overcome your grounding issue. But, without that proper ground any lightning protection on your tower is apt not to be the shortest path to earth and will likely fail.

It s a nice way to work from lower power machines. To do this, of course, does require an Azure account, and after your intro phase would be paid.The support services provide things like source control, work item tracking, and similar in the cloud but they work with your VS2013 install, wether on a desktop or on a VM on Azure.Hope that clears things up!

Your link as I read it is basically saying we are all collectively responsible for good and evil, and that there are supposedly unpopular evils which we ourselves create and implicitly endorse, often counterintuitively.That doesn t mean we ought to just give up and worship whatever worst thing capitalism produces. If you look at Ginsberg s long history of political activism as an example it s certainly not what he and those around him lived.At a separate scale from that discussion we need to play our side of the game, and that will necessarily involve your personal interpretation of ethics.

2013-10-15 16:06:56.000	The appearance of risk is more important to most businesses than actual risk. Ruby isn t dominant, therefore it is perceived as risky ...That s not quite right. Anecdotally, I ve seen or read about big corps using hot JS front-end frameworks like Angular and Backbone, server frameworks and databases like Node.js, MongoDB and Redis, and programming languages like Python, Erlang and Scala in production. Even if you look at the big tech corps such as Yahoo, Google, Twitter, Facebook, Amazon , internally there isn t a whole lot of Ruby either. The big poster-child for Ruby, Twitter, is now most known for migrating away from Ruby than for actually using it.I m not a Ruby guy, but it doesn t seem like cliche corporate conservatism is what s holding Ruby back. It looks like it s Ruby, and specifically the Ruby platform. Maybe pretty Ruby language semantics aren t enough to make up for Ruby platform downsides. Maybe there just isn t a good reason to use Ruby. Java s complexity might actually threaten the survival of a small projectThe choice of Java would not threaten the survival of any small project. Though Java is still not a very pretty language, the tooling around it has gotten enormously better from where we were in, say, 2003.

We are bordering on a Cold War we aren t about to trust them to keep their promises on crypto.I think a more moderate take would be suggesting a straddle of the EU - either it strangles itself with clunky bureaucracy, or it becomes more closely unified and a world power in the likes of the US, Russia, or China.Furthermore, I think we could see the United States grow with the additions of Guam, Puerto Rico, and or Greenland.

2024-03-14 07:12:05.000	I don t know anyone who is recommending against flakes these days. The experimental label is more about the API stability than completeness, bugginess, or anything else. Experimental traditionally means if you use it and it breaks, then that s your fault . This is because if did break, the entire internet would dogpile on any complainers with IT WAS LABELLED EXPERIMENTAL WHAT WERE YOU EXPECTING. It s the same as ignoring Kickstarter warnings if a project gives you a warning then tell you to ignore that same warning, don t if things go to shit then everyone will say YOU WERE WARNED WHAT WERE YOU EXPECTING. They cannot un-warn you, that s not how this social situation works. I m not claiming this is fair, I m just claiming this is how it plays out in practice.The only safe response to this is to assume that anything labelled experimental is exactly what it says. And to be clear, that means the only safe response is to ignore any claims that the thing labelled experimental is safe.Or to put it another way if you don t mean it s experimental and do recommend it to the average user, then don t use the term experimental .

I think it was better when browsers had status bars and IE put a badge in the corner, e.g. indicating when the current page encountered an error during the execution of a script. It forced publishers to confront the shoddiness of their work and deal with it if for no other reason than out of sheer embarrassment. button in forms submit the form by default. If you don t want that behavior add type button . No need for event.preventDefault That, too, would be user-hostile. Keep your markup semantic so agents can reason about the content on a page. Don t just target incidental behavior.

2023-12-13 08:03:50.000	There are plenty of things that could destroy all human life on Earth and not destroy all human life on all planets.Also the argument taken to an extreme is straightforward. We know that massive catastrophes have caused mass extinctions that wiped out most life on Earth. This is clearly visible in the fossil record. Ergo, one of these is certain to happen again. In the extremely long term, the Sun will get hot enough to kill all life on Earth in a couple hundred million years. So Humankind is doomed if we do stay on just Earth for the very long term.There s also the side argument that right now appears very close to making it possible. If Starship and the attempt at reusable rockets were to disappear there s nothing guaranteeing the progress of space technology. It s easy to see a future where we do some more footprints on the Moon and maybe later some footprints on Mars, but no permanent off-earth colony is ever established. Eventually we give up on creating such bases because they re deemed too expensive and robots do it better as our robotic technology gets better and better. The technology of how to do reusable vehicles is eventually forgotten over several generations and then we never leave Earth again. Eventually resulting in our destruction. This is a why not now? argument.

2014-05-27 15:30:16.000	This doesn t solve the problem of combining arbitrary grammars - there s obviously restrictions on what you can add where, or a requirement to add special delimiters around child grammars so that they can be parsed correctly, but Nemerle takes a practical approach to the problem. You still cannot nest arbitrary grammars inside others several layers deep - as each nested language requires consideration of its parents to get the parse you intended.If you re interested in the problem of combining grammars, I d encourage you to check out Diekmann Tratt s Language Boxes demo which provide an elegant solution to the problem, although with the obvious caveat that it diverges from plain-text file representation of code, and requires an intelligent editor like their example implementation, eco an interesting project would be to combine the two approaches, by having a language-box aware editor which could automatically insert the correct delimiters around language-boxes inferred by usage , and produce plain-text representations which could still be understood by Nemerle Nitra, which is language-box unaware.

During the days when the financial crisis was hot and fresh this brand of naysaying seemed really insightful and prescient - but, in retrospect, it was just something of a firehose of short the system. That a lot of analysts read it doesn t make it credible. A lot of politicos read infowars too - it doesn t mean it isn t mostly hyped up garbage.Far too many of their headlines are too sensationalist and make too many testable claims and predictions - they are chicken little, and the sky simply hasn t fallen.

2020-05-26 07:39:48.000	Pretty much all of the companies I ve worked for in the last 20 years have most of these boxes ticked. They definitely exists. To be fair, at most of these companies, I ve had a hand in the processes - However I would say that it s actually a pretty low bar mostly.The main sticking points I experience are Cross functional collaboration . There are entire categories of work where this isn t really easy feasible. The actual users are not available, so you must use a proxy. The opportunity for improvement is where they developers have some say in how the proxy acts can everyone see the same data they work on, is there an opportunity for feedback, etc .Things like functionally complete vs ready for production require a strong management presence for the development team. IMHO, the easiest way to solve this is by not having a distinction between the two. Don t make it functionally complete before it is ready for production. This requires breaking down the work differently than a lot of organisations like. You need a strong lead dev manager who will take high level items in the backlog and break them down into vertical stripes of functionality that can be delivered incrementally. It can be quite a political problem, but this is probably the place where a lot of organisations are going to run into trouble.Another common problem especially with smaller teams is the lack of career progression. This should be obvious when you start. If the group is small and not geared for growing rapidly, you will not likely get a promotion. It s simple math - No spots for promotion means no promotion.There are a couple things on this list that I would dispute, though. Celebrating taking initiatives there are pluses and minuses here. Some developers just do crazy stuff. Other developers do nothing for fear of criticism. It s not really the case that you want to have people indiscriminately taking initiatives. It s more that everyone should have opportunities and everyone should be encouraged to take those opportunities occasionally. There is always a balance -- going too far one way or another is really bad for everyone.CI and CD deploying directly to production Sometimes a good idea. Often not a good idea. In reality, you want a human or some humans making the call as to whether or not something should go. If you make it an automated part of the process, then people will put blocks earlier in the process to ensure that customers are not surprised, or stakeholders get a chance to OK the final product, or deployment meets marketing schedules, or there is a final quality check for risky work. What often happens is that these blocks become adhoc rather than part of the process. Usually it is better in my experience to always have manual deployment although it should always be easy to the point of triviality to do it .I think how I would take this list is more as a set of questions you can bring with you on your job interviews. How does the company handle these things? What are the opportunities for improvement? How eager does the organisation seem to implement these improvements? If you join a team and you have significant friction in many areas, it s basically too late. You should probably start looking for a better place to work.

The main point being discussed here is you are obviously viewing inconsistent viewpoints as a negative trait while in fact it is positive and desirable in my personal interpretation.My previous comments were simply an analysis of the current world trends which I have observed. I even clarified to you that I was referring to McKenzie Bezos so I am unsure why you were being so defensive and even aggressive in accusing me of such.Let s just leave it here as we should never force our own personal views onto others.

Of course no one would criticize a girl who picked up a cello and just started playing for just not being a cellist, but also no one would advise her to simply practice alone. The best advice is for that girl to find a good teacher and get some lessons.I find it interesting that Derek downplays the role of his teachers. He mentions he took lessons with several teachers, but neglects to tell us anything about them. I could not begin to describe my development as a singer without discussing my teachers.Yes, it takes practice to become a good singer, but any number of hours of practicing poor technique won t do much good.

2014-08-13 17:01:17.000	I was wondering about the name change from SOA to Microservices myself.I think both monolith and microservice architectures are valid, it just requires software architects to think a bit more about the size of the problem. If you just have a slow growing self-contained app, then monolith is probably the way to go.If you have an app that has the potential to grow quickly, or is already integrating with multiple external services, it may make sense to look at microservices.We switched from monolith to SOA a couple of years ago, and it s been a net win in terms of price, reliability of site performance, and ease of development. There were the obvious drawbacks you stated above of network timeouts, lag, and async issues, but it s just a different set of problems.

Tarkovsky s version is my favorite but I grew up with Soviet cinema so maybe that s why though one can argue his films are so outside the norm with Soviet cinema that it wouldn t matter .One of the keys to Tarkovsky s movies is that he is concerned with human relationships primarily. Romantic relationships, parents and children, etc. Even when he directed sci-Fi movies, they were never about rockets, aliens, shooting, explosions.This quote from the movie, illustrates that well I think ---We don t want to conquer space at all. We want to expand Earth endlessly. We don t want other worlds we want a mirror. We seek contact and will never achieve it. We are in the foolish position of a man striving for a goal he fears and doesn t want. Man needs man!---I remember watching this movie and being disappointed because I expected more sci-fi stuff. Same thing with Stalker, his other sci-fi film. Only after seeing The Mirror my favorite of his films started liking his other movies.

2018-11-06 06:27:29.000	If Apple s HQ were Albuquerque or El Paso, you d have talent moving to those places. For startups, obviously proximity to Silicon Valley, Austin or NYC is very advantageous because nobody wants to move across the country for a low percentage startup. But for a FAANG company the talent will follow, perhaps even more merrily.Nope.FAANG companies want top talent. Top talent has many options. Most top talented engineers, in this market, get multiple offers and can basically choose where they want to live.Not to mention that all FAANG companies have offices in attractive locations. So the office in Buttfuck Nowhere would be competing against offices in cool cities like LA and NYC, for the same position with the same FAANG. Good luck with that.

2023-01-20 12:31:11.000	The best part about people who take every word literally and demand punishment is that no punishment will ever satisfy all of them.It wouldn t matter if Sundar took a pay cut like Tim Cook because the same people would say he s still worth hundreds of millions. It wouldn t matter if he fired himself because there would be some other, equally fallible human being in the same role that he vacated. That person would be capable of making the same mistake Sundar did.Have these people never worked in a real organisation where people make mistakes? When an engineer causes an incident, we fixed it and then did a review to understand how we can improve the process to prevent such an incident in future. We didn t point fingers, we didn t demand punishment.Here s the thing - Sundar is still probably the best person to helm Google, despite this mistake. In fact, a person who has had to lay off thousands will definitely think twice before going on a hiring spree in future. Exactly the sort of person you want in charge.

2013-06-14 23:32:55.000	AFAIK, the current publicly-known record for breaking RSA keys is the factorization of RSA-768 in 2010 That paper says it took about 1500 CPU-years to break a 768-bit key, and that the difficulty increases 1000x for each additional 256 bits of key length.For a back-of-the-envelope cost estimate, I m going to assume that there have been no major theoretical breakthroughs in the last couple of years, and that the machines they used were roughly equivalent to an EC2 medium instance. That puts the cost of breaking a 768-bit key, using spot instances for cost-efficiency, at about US 200k.That sounds small, but encryption decryption are still reasonably efficient with larger keys, while factorization becomes vastly harder. Breaking a 2048-bit key would take something like 200 quadrillion dollars worth of CPU time. A 4096-bit key, like the one used for this message, would be vastly more secure than that.

2007-03-07 11:23:36.000	I have read up on OpenID s specifications and what it aims to deliver. If it is labeled a bandwagon, I think it may be a good one to jump onto. There a few provisions one must be wary of regarding security, but for the most part I believe it is a move in a positive direction for managing web identities.

2008-12-12 14:56:10.000	My biggest horror with all this new W3C tech, is that in reality it s really old. Because of Microsoft s stupid mistakes while reigning power over the browser world, we ve been in this 10 year period of stagnation in which we ve go nowhere.There s no real laws you can put against Microsoft, but if this were a real world situation, we d be trying them for crimes against humanity. They have effectively ceased innovation for an incredible amount of time, and I would go ahead and say that they ve slowed down the exceedingly fast development of the last decade.CSS3, Javascript 2, HTML 5, XHTML 2, etc. should ve came out years ago. Possibly in different forms, but nonetheless this monopolization over a browser market has killed _everything_.I am glad that Google is getting into this game. Not only because it will definitely give Microsoft a run for its money, but we will finally have new innovation that before seemed to take years to implement.
2022-06-01 23:10:15.000	I think Meta will underdeliver, yes.But the Metaverse is alive and well, at least if you can detach yourself of that superficial XR vision many people are touting online.Just look at people buing skins for games and using filters and faceapps for their social media photos and videos.I know many friends that are very active on social media, and they don t look like themselves anymore.Sure, this isn t interactive XR content, but it s a whole virtual world that has detatched itself from reality years ago.
2016-12-09 20:32:57.000	Asking for a phone number seems pretty valid.The number of times people forget their password, or accidentally type it into a phishing site, or re-use passwords across different websites where one of them e.g. Yahoo get breached....Without a recovery phone number, these people are hosed - and they ve lost data, photos, contacts, email, their entire digital life etc. That s a pretty poor user experience. So most people are like - yeah, OK, that sounds reasonable, let me put a phone number I can access just in case somebody hacks my account.NB I work for Google, but I don t speak for them here in any official capacity.

2016-08-24 11:44:50.000	Ad-hoc seems subjective but to me it feels very carefully thought out.I guess I d like to see a simple formalism. myself and many others I know being easily able to get high performance code when we need it.That s true for a lot of languages. It doesn t make it Rust-level. I m not arguing against static type systems in principle, but these are practical concerns rather than theoretical ones. I don t know of a mainstream static language that supports a fully dynamic REPL Haskell s isn t great and casting back and forth to interface , Object , or Any everywhere is a huge overhead compared to duck typing. I look forward to a future language solving those issues, but that s not the case today.Shrug, not my experience. I don t know what you mean by fully generic , but I ve been very happy with the Scala REPL - I ve never once thought this would be easy in the Python REPL but I can t do it because of the type system . Casting is indeed a big overhead if you re doing it everywhere, but my experience is the cases where you need it are extremely rare.

2022-06-08 13:31:12.000	I don t see it that way. What I see is systems that have behaviours that look like human behaviours - for example, generating and recognising text, or recognising images, etc but what these systems really do is nothing like whatever humans do, and the behaviours they produce are not the same behaviours as those of humans, after all.For example, we can see that clearly in chess and other board games. Chess engines play by executing some variant of the minimax algorithm and they can out-play humans. But human players don t typcially try to run minimax in their heads when they play and in any case can play chess without trying to emulate a chess engine. The same goes for image classifiers it is extremely unlikely that we match sets of pixels to numerical labels in our heads, to the point of absurdity and for language models again it s absurdly unlikely that we calculate the probabilities of sequences of tokens .I think what you say comes from an assumption that because humans exhibit certain behaviours, and humans have human intelligence, any system that exhibits similar behaviours must also have human intelligence. Which, if you look carefully, does not follow.Anyway historically people have always been quick to identify the capabilities of computers as artificial intelligence, just because we tend to think of anything to do with computation as requiring intelligence. But we had machines that could perform calculations automatically, through entirely mechanical procedures, for more than 200 years now, and most of those we don t think are artificially intelligent. For example, I don t think anyone would consider the Pascaline to be an AI, and yet the Pascaline can do better arithmetic from any non-human animal, and from many human animals, also. So, does arithmetic require intelligence, or not?How much of what we can do thanks to our intelligence can also be done by a dumb, mechanical automatism? This I think is the important question in AI research today and one that, if we could answer it which we can t would finally put the lid on wishful thinking about LLMs exhibiting a different sampling of intelligence than ours.

2023-07-07 21:52:38.000	AMD has the patents for putting a SSD directly on the card, they could be killing it in the home AI market, but.... they just can t get it together.Radeon SSG was just a PCIe switch chip on-card, with the SSD GPU behind it, so functionally it is the same as having the SSD on the motherboard.I m not sure if they got patents but either way the problem it solved was not the one people think it solved. It wasn t using the SSD as memory , and in the way that it did block storage any other SSD GPU can function identically in the same way without needing the SSG tech. Putting the SSD on your mobo performs as high in every way on any GPU CUDA RDMA Direct have been around for a while, since Fermi Kepler at least .It was just a convenience thing of getting a SSD mountpoint built into your GPU basically. They even showed up as a HBA in windows and were treated as a striped disk. recently this idea has re-surfaced with some of the modern GPUs with x8 interfaces 6600XT, 4060 Ti, etc getting a couple M.2 drives in the other x4x4 via bifurcation, and this functionally performs the same as SSG but without the switch chip needs hardware support instead . And if there are patents around using a switch chip that may be how the patent is evaded. But combination cards utilizing more than one type of hardware in general is not that novel network card ssd combos are another popular one and I m not sure AMD patented it or it s defensibly novel against prior art.
2021-09-24 03:18:28.000	This is a part of our industry I do not follow beyond headlines. A lot of those headlines are about hackers trying to be responsible getting screwed out of supposed bounties that to my mind already appear quite small. Also responsible companies doing very little to quickly close them. Does anyone have any insight into how the market for vulnerabilities operates? Is there is a significant disparity in price between official responsible disclosures and private sales?

2021-07-21 07:43:01.000	With all the wrongs about Turbo Tax and monopolizing tax filing - criticisms are appropriate. That said, I much prefer the US system. The US IRS already knows what how much tax an indiviual owes just like the Dutch government. Having to manually file taxes is a feature, not a bug IMO. The only difference is that the US IRS assumes you d want to itemize and customize your tax return by default whereas the Dutch government makes standard deductions the default. I wouldn t want the government to just send me a number of what I owe. Sure you can challenge it, but I prefer the default to be that the citizen files taxes and the government can tally up the proposed taxes against the data they have and either accept or challenge it.However, this Turbo Tax monopoly needs to go. There should be a free OSS software that can file the taxes.

You are unable to think neutrally, your frame of reference itself has been determined for you. The term you mean I think is killing .Do you really think it is the state that is giving you freedom to live your life though? Or, could it be, that the state enables millions of immoral transgressions tax aka stealing, etc and calls them right or good ?

My process is roast chillies put in plastic bag in fridge wait 10 mins scrape off skin. Where s the solar fridge, and the team of chilli scrapers? Scraping one chilli is a job that takes about a minute. A 20lb drum of raosted chillies I d guess is a day s work.
2020-03-26 14:55:40.000	First of all the millions of deaths comes from one model. There are many others and we haven t tested enough to know the true spread or lethality of the virus in a general population. It s quite possible that many people have already had covid-19 and were completely asymptomatic, which would make the death rate look much less scary. Anyone who tells you with certainty that millions will die is going off incomplete data like everyone else at the moment.And if we locked down the global economy for a year or two until a vaccine is developed, yes it s not out of the realm of possibility that millions worldwide would die a result of the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th order consequences of that decision. Look how many stress fractures are occurring after just a few weeks. You think they ll get better with time and continued stress?Honestly I think the UK had the best original strategy of locking down the people most at risk, make sure they re taken care of as much as possible, and letting everyone else get herd immunity as quick as possible. But people weren t aren t willing to accept that, and likely still won t for at least the next few weeks.

With a properly chimneyed fireplace though he had to improvise because his area did not have enough clay in the soil.He s had the channel for a long time. I knew his channel before. His bow was a simple longbow he made himself. He regularly goes elk and boar hunting with his bows. He also tried fishing but had a bad spot but got lucky encountering a deer. He built a smoker with an automatic bear alarm. They really don t show a lot of him on the show if you compare. I think basically because he just did so well overall. He did carve toys to bring back to his sons too.

2022-06-05 22:28:56.000	I find a fair amount of places that stay open to accommodate weekend business generally close on Mondays and Tuesdays.Which makes sense to me, but people still raise a stink that retail isn t seven days a week like it used to be. A lot of people still remember the early 2010s when Seattle was open later than it is today. There used to be a lot of 24-hour or late-night spots. Beth s, Lost Lake, 13 Coins, North Star, Third Shift Bar, and the like. QFC, Metro Market, and Safeway all had 24-hour grocery shopping. The big Starbucks in University Village used to be open 24 7, then got trimmed back to just 2am, and is now 9pm.But this comes with trade-offs people don t want to work miserable jobs with crap scheduling and low pay hoping for tips and not get appreciated for it. The pandemic showed people they don t have to do that, but those who are used to plentiful services are salty because, hey, it turns out service employees are humans, too! Light rail is closed from midnight to 5I agree that Sound Transit needs to explain exactly why they need 35 hours a week for maintenance when other agencies manage to pull it off in a fraction of the time.But, to be fair to the rail, buses do still exist and we did a big restructure of our overnight bus service such that the routes actually exist and make some sense. Having ridden the 83 or 84 home more than once, those old owl routes were a travesty.

One study that is particular interesting is this one shows that east asian children, who very rarely have nut allergies in their home countries, develop nut allergies at a higher rate than non-asian children when born in Australia while east asian children who immigrate to Australia after their early infancy continue to maintain very low rates of nut allergies.

2019-10-26 21:40:49.000	There s a nice paper by the philosopher David Lewis is a copy of it I don t know whether it s in any sense a legal copy that offers though it doesn t exactly endorse the following justification for this 1. Imagine a system where the punishment for murder is exactly the same as the punishment for attempted murder, but that punishment has an element of chance you might get a longer or a shorter sentence.This doesn t seem particularly unreasonable. Now we re going to make successive modifications to the system, which Lewis claims don t obviously make it worse.2. Now suppose that we attempt to make the punishment for more wholehearted attempts at murder greater. It s hard to tell what was in the criminal s heart, so as a reasonable proxy we try to evaluate, somehow, how likely the murder attempt was to succceed, and we punish more-likely-to-succeed attempts more harshly.3. Now suppose, more specifically, that the way in which we punish more-likely-to-succeed attempts more harshly is by increasing the probability of getting the longer sentence. In fact, we ll say that the probability of getting the longer sentence is to be the same as our estimate of how likely the attempt at murder was to succeed.4. How to estimate that probability? One effective but obviously impractical way would be to run some sort of reenactment or simulation of the crime, and give the longer sentence if and only if the victim dies. Aha! But we can simplify and improve this by using the original crime as the reenactment, and give the longer sentence if and only if the actual victim died.And now we ve arrived at pretty much our present practice!
2014-07-23 05:04:54.000	Having an official explanation what the processes do is very welcome, but this still leaves out the question whether there is a way to access these daemons without prior user approval.And if there is, the question is, who has access to that method and how well that access is protected from rogue employees with access to keys for example At this point, I would still consider all data on my phone to be accessible to law enforcement and criminals assuming they have stolen the keys provided they have physical access to the device.I m basing the data stored on the device on that assumption and, for example, keep ssh keys separately encrypted and don t store the pass phrase.

Why not respond to what I DID say?As for banter, yes it is. 99.99999 of such talk is BS bravado from kids that would never do anything to act on that, and in fact would go to bed crying if someone told their parents what they said.Second, is that kind of talk like the one you quote constrained against women? In the gaming forums males say things like I ll kill you and piss down your neck all the time. And lots of males and maybe females uses such threats over the internet anonymously to other men too.

However, given the quality of the software from Adobe in general and all the security holes that have been exploited for Acrobat over the years, I can advise everyone not to use Adobe PDF Acrobat Reader and instead open PDF files in Firefox pdf.js or Chrome pdfium .A look at the PDF specification is enough to know that it is a hard task to parse such a complex file format without memory bugs the file is read backwards, which is why the x-ref table is at the end of the file, actually PDF is supposed to be exclusively ASCII... except that every PDF contains binary streams and in addition functions and properties which are defined are ignored even by Adobe Reader. I wrote some PDF-fuzzers a few years ago and the whole file format is a huge mess..
2011-03-28 13:48:07.000	The HTPC is the caviar solution. I messed around with dedicated units such as an ASUS O!play highly recommended if you just need to stream media in your network . Also tried streaming media with the Blu-ray drive that came free with my TV. Even tried the pre-built Dell Zino HD with it s tiny atom like intel processor.In the end, an HTPC is what _I_ needed wanted . I can stream from netflix, play a blu-ray, watch youtube without a wonky interface like the blu-ray players tv have , stream media from my WHS Windows Home Server , etc. It plays everything I throw at it.Is it perfect? No way. Too complicated for my wife family mere mortals to run and it has the downsides of a full Winders stack constant updates, etc .But, at this point I don t see a true alternative. Codecs are king. I can download almost any software codec combo and play the media.I run and i3 and find it to be a perfect combination of speed power consumption for an almost silent media pc.Btw, the little Dell handles everything fine. The major complaint is that the tiny fan spins up when watching blu-ray high-def flash content. That s one of the major downsides to a prebuilt PC. Usually one area sucks. I love the tiny Dell form factor but the whine of the fan is a negative.
2020-11-02 12:27:07.000	a country the size of Europe with a population of 25mYou must not have spent much time here. Most Australians live in a narrow band stretched along the south east coast. Victoria, which has just come out of a 4 month lockdown, has nearly 7m residents in about 240 thousand sq km. Slightly smaller, but on par with Sweden. Like Sweden, two thirds of the state is virtually empty. Though in Victoria, we have a much more dense urban centre. The rest of Australia is similar, very small, dense urban centre with vast tracks of unoccupied land.Yes, we can compare these if we are careful about the similarities and differences. Our populated areas have similar densities as various population centres across Europe. Our cities have been cut off from regional areas, and our states closed off from each other, which seems like maybe a bigger deal than if European states closed off from each other.Maybe nuance is hard when you have a point to make.

The kernel has always moved at a snails-pace, even for longtime contributors. Dealing with the quirks of unsupported hardware isn t their job, it s completely unsurprising that these maintainers don t take M1 support seriously in the same way they treat Intel or AMD-submitted patches.If Apple wanted the Macbook to have quick Linux support, they should have merged the patches themselves.

2010-12-06 09:13:50.000	I came to a similar realization but unfortunately not until 5 or so books into the Wheel of Time series. I think I found myself reading a 10 page section in which several women were doing their hair and gossiping about the men in their lives and realized based on that scene plus some other trends I started seeing in previous books that the series had jumped the shark and the author was now just trying to pump up the page count and make the series run as long as possible, to milk it. Thankfully I got out well before he blew past what was originally intended to be the final book in the series, which of course was not.I read the first one or two Game of Thrones books, thought they were awesome, and much much higher quality level than what Wheel of Tome became, but, alas, by then I had too much fantasy medieval magic fatigue and put them down. I will likely pick them up again.
2011-11-14 04:00:35.000	The main issue with automatic translation of mathematics into code is that mathematicians often define concepts without regard for their computability.Here are two examples 1. Consider the set of Turing machines that halt on a certain string. This set is logically sound, but it s impossible, in general, to create a computer program that can decide membership on the set.2. Non-constructive there exists style proofs. For example, take Peano s existence theorem. This helps characterize an important class of ODEs that clearly have solutions but lends no help towards actually constructing solution s .

2019-08-26 09:14:58.000	Q. At time t1 0, we know the state of our system. Then we send a photon into an atom. Assume the atom absorbs the photon by having an electron move to a different energy level.Some time later, at time t2, the electron returns to where it was and emits a photon. As I understand, t2 - t1 is random, with exponential distribution, and independent of everything else in the universe. So, at time t2, we cannot recover the state at time t1 or even know just when t1 was. That is, the reversible time evolution equation of state at time t2 can t tell us the random time t2 - t1 or t1 so cannot recover the state at time t1 -- at time t2, we just do not know just when or how we got to the state at time t2.So, the time evolution equation is time reversible but the event of the emission of the photon is not time reversible.This thought experiment seems to conflict with the OP. Where am I going wrong?

Someone shows some creative thinking and does so in a way that is obviously 1 quite naive without ill intent. While I understand that you want to discourage the specific behavior, perhaps steering the culprit to use talents with more foresight would have been a better answer. 1 Looking back, I was something of an asshat in the personal skills department so it s entirely possible that they simply didn t believe my lack of nefarious intent.

The 8086 was first, ahead of the 8088.

I hear you on the debugging nightmare that this can be does a given variable get resolved when the function is first call ed, when the block gets eval ed, or when the recipe is invoked? But IMHO it s not too bad to do printf-style debugging. Replace eval call ... with error call ... , then work backwards from there.It also helps to be very disciplined about immediate assignment var stmt and to always use recipe-local variables, rather than global variables.I do feel like all of this aspect would be cleaner in Python or Lua... but the problem is, the _rest_ of the build, which more people interact with on a daily basis, gets more complex when that happens. Because there are always the ancillary targets and recipes where normal Makefile syntax works just fine.Thanks for the NDK reference, I m interested in seeing other ugly Makefile support infrastructure for comparison

2021-11-13 17:20:27.000	Maybe we could just have kept Rust as it was circa 2016, and let the crazy non-blocking folks write hand-crafted epoll loops like they do in C . I honestly don t know, and think it s a difficult problem to solve. I think this is the most underappreciated part of this article. Since when did everything have to be async? There are other ways to represent concurrency that more accurately reflect what the computer is actually doing.For example, an alternative to async is to represent a workstream as a state machine, where state transitions happen between I O. Then, your state machine can be a struct, and each state transition can be an impl function on that struct that takes one or more completed I O requests as input and emits one or more I O requests as output. This saves you from having to implement everything as a closure, which this article rants about. Your top-level epoll loop merely services I O requests from state machine instances, and invokes your global application logic to start and stop state machines to carry out business logic tasks.I realize that many complicated workstreams could have many states due to all the I O they might do, but the task of converting a high-level workstream into a state machine could be automated by the tooling.

2021-11-23 16:45:55.000	I ve encountered various situations that could all be described this way but for very different reasons. eg.1 The feedback is not actionable because the manager is themselves not clear in their head or is skirting around the real issue on their mind.2 The feedback cannot be actionable because the manager only has partial information and can say there is an issue, not diagnose it and recommend corrective action. They are relying on their report to introspect and diagnose themselves.3 The feedback is actionable, but the person wants the action plan itself to come from the manager. Not always possible.In my experience the answer to all three is to develop the action plan together. Any blind spots and vagueness on both sides get cleared by this forcing function. Helps set expectations too.

There is no reason for the author, the reviewer if there even was such a person , or anyone else to believe that the bug existed or was fixed by this change. The PR does not include tests is not the same as nobody performed any tests is not the same as nobody actually noticed a bug .And of course, it s perfectly reasonable to form beliefs about code from reading it.
2024-04-21 12:08:15.000	I am not sure the comparison between England and Scotland is valid. Scotland is is much less densely populated has much smaller cities. The population of the whole of Scotland is much smaller than that of greater London. There is surely a generation of older people living in 2 3 4 bedroom houses that don t really need that space, but aren t willing to pay today s prices for a smaller place that hasn t been made their own homeYes, but what do you do about it?In the areas I know all sizes of house have gone up in price, so they would make a MUCH bigger profit on downsizing than when they bought houses a few decades ago. There was a bedroom tax imposed on people still living in Council housing that had empty bedrooms which didn t apply to private housing.I thought it applied to housing benefit? You no longer get housing benefit to pay for the extra room. Its also not empty rooms as such its having more rooms than the govt thinks you need, so things such as young kids having their own rooms rather than sharing.

2024-06-06 06:42:32.000	That s the case when there is a market where demand is dynamic and a person can simply refuse to buy decreasing demand if the prices are too high. Milk is like this.But in rental market, the demand is not dynamic. You HAVE to get an apartment to live in once your lease is up. If 80 of the complexes around you are on this and on top of that the independents also set their pricing based on the market controlled by the majority, then they can charge you whatever they want. You HAVE to buy and you HAVE to get it with the price dictated by them. There is absolutely no supply and demand in this at play.
2018-05-17 14:15:30.000	So de Vries calculated how much electricity bitcoin miners would have to consume for bitcoin mining to no longer be profitable. He assumed that electricity prices make up 60 percent of the cost of mining and that electricity costs an average of 5 cents per KWh. That yielded energy consumption of 7.7GW, which serves as an upper bound of the bitcoin network s energy consumptionThat s not the upper bound, since there a monetization strategies that end up using other people s hardware and electricity. Websites that run JavaScript miners are ridiculously inefficient but also don t have to meet his profitability formula because the electricity is paid by someone different than the person entity that gets the Bitcoin.

2017-06-22 07:55:10.000	Is there some waste in school systems? Sure. But probably not as much as you think.The cost of buildings, the maintenance, insurance, water, electricity all add up very quickly. Associated staff costs aren t cheap either - many schools have a nurse on staff to deal with injuries and illness, for example. Counselors psychologists help troubled students. Learning specialists help deal with certain problems - as an example, when I was in kindergarten I was sent to a speech therapist a couple of times a week. Teaching assistants help care for the more severely disabled - some of them basically have a dedicated assistant based on their disability.Buses aren t cheap either, and in rural areas, you might need several smaller buses to get everyone to school in a reasonable amount of time.Schools in more urban areas often have security guards, and most schools have put more money into physical security as well with the perceived rise in school shootings not trying to start a debate as to whether or not this is happening .Administrators and secretaries plan and organize everything that isn t directly related to teaching, handle some disciplinary issues, and interface with other government agencies, the school board, and the board of education at the state and sometimes even federal level.Education is expensive, and you can t start cutting out pieces of this without very quickly impacting the students.
2023-09-20 09:25:13.000	Is this your test, just in case? not very sure how you have compared the speed. cjxl -e 9 for example is known to be very slow because it is AFAIK basically -e 8 with a brute-force parameter search and I think this level should be hidden in some way for this exact reason, it is very misleading . Also I assume that you have done an end-to-end command line test with relatively small inputs, which might be a major pitfall because it doesn t only measure the PNG encoder decoder but also all program invocation time and finalization time, which can be specficially optimized 1 .Also only relying on a single objective metric might be misleading, and Jon Sneyers one of JPEG XL devs has a very good plot that illustrates this 2 and pointed out that actual images have to be also manually reviewed to reduce mistakes. Many comparisons are made against images with similar SSIM scores, but it is unclear if they indeed had similar qualities. And an ideal perceptual metric is not enough, specifics on taking the AVIF format points as a basis and comparing them with the similarity and similar ratio points would be necessary to evaluate the test. 1 For example you can skip free on complicated structures because they will be reclaimed by the kernel anyway. Of course this is totally unacceptable for libraries. 2 The ideal metric should strongly correlate to the human score and should not distort the relative score difference. Most metrics---except for SSIMULACRA 2 which specifically being developed with this dataset---are bad at both.

Most of the time advertising is a waste of time, and there certainly are better ways of learning about products. However, the function of informing consumers of products they may not be aware of is of mild benefit.A better question than what benefit is advertising might be, How can advertising be made more beneficial to the viewers

In Square s case, that s buyers and sellers who are both customers of the Square platform.It seems obvious, but I understand what Dorsey s getting at. I ve struggled with finding appropriately specific identifiers, and when in doubt just lumped everyone together as users. Context matters. Square happens to be one of those paid services whose categories of users are pretty easy to identify and name. Like you guys mentioned in your comments, redefining specific terms for users of free services and search engines isn t quite as simple. I would suggest freeloaders or browsers but that would take us in the wrong direction I m content being labeled a user for now.

In the case of the US, this is CALEA, and every phone company should be able to provide a backdoor that allows the agencies to follow court orders and tap phones. Brazil has similar laws for the phone networks.The problem with the attitude of the Brazilian courts in regards to Whatsapp is that they are not a telco. The abomination that is the Marco Civil, which is being used as a justification to enforce the court request and says data should be retained by companies for one year, does not help.

Later in the season the sap has less sugar naturally so it is boiled more to concentrate the sugar, which also concentrates the other flavors. That later season sap makes Grade B. Is that the case? In that way grading makes sense, Grade A being more naturally pure, but knowing that it is only based on color throws out the whole point to me. I definitely have had maple syrup I felt had too harsh a flavor, maybe it was Grade B as I m used to Grade A.
2020-09-15 13:16:14.000	I m by no means an expert, but I think there s some amount of adaptation that occurs. I feel like I had to train my body to fast. I had a similar problem and it was really unpleasant the first time I tried a fast, but recently did a three day fast with no discomfort right until the end. The end was weird because I told myself I was going to break my fast, and my stomach kicked into action too early, making me sick. Like I went from very little hunger to RAVENOUS. Had to break my fast at a drive through best chalupa I ve ever tasted! For me at least I go into fasting by first skipping breakfast for a few days, then skipping breakfast and lunch. Skipping dinner is mostly a mental hurdle because there s so much psychological signaling that you should eat at dinner time and don t really know what else to do with yourself. Going to bed without eating in a day feels weird at first.I also make sure to get lots of electrolytes during all of this, magnesium glycinate and lite salt seem to do the trick. Otherwise I start to get shaky and have bad headaches.

2021-04-28 07:39:37.000	Yes, Android is open source. The operating system on your Android phone is not open source.What you re refering to as Android, is in fact, Google Play Services Android, or as I ve recently taken to calling it, Google Play Services plus Android. Android is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another component of a fully functioning Google Play Services system.Many mobile users run a modified version of the Google Play Services system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of Google Play Services which is widely used today is often called Android, and many of its users are not aware.There really is a Android, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Google Play Services is the core the program in the system that is required for full functionality of a mobile device. The core is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Android is normally used in combination with Google Play Services the whole system is basically Google Play Services with Android added, or Google Play Services Android. All the so-called Android ROMs are really distributions of Google Play Services Android!

You can also take Ed Kmett s approach and just do --force --reinstall every time. I prefer the sandboxes though, when something breaks you can always nuke the sandbox and quickly reinstall. I would recommend upgrading to Cabal 1.18.x and try the sandboxes out.

2024-05-12 08:36:42.000	I m not discouraging people from trying anything for themselves. I wholeheartedly encourage people to try everything and have their own experiences. I was simply stating my opinion and IMO some cold hard facts.OpenBSD is just minimal and clutter free, but it s not like there are not Linux distros with basically the exact same traits - Slackware, Void and Alpine are all incredibly comparable.My only real point was that OBSD has much worse graphical performance because it isn t a priority. Most of the developers are probably the types that pride themselves on not using a GUI as though that was something impressive.IMO, given two no-nonsense desktop operating systems, I think the one with significantly better graphical performance among other things like app support, makes far more sense.

Do they feel like the majority female create a toxic environment for them, making them feel uneasy about working in that field?But I ll add one more 3 People in STEM might actually be very open minded and progressive, much more open to talk about issues and much more interested in fixing them, and not letting bias be truth. This might be why you hear about women in stem and their difficulties, while you rarely hear about the difficulties of women in other male dominated fields.

This article explains why factory farming is dangerous with regards to bird flu The conditions on these farms greatly contribute to the creation of deadly pathogens, including influenza viruses. Here s how it works Wild aquatic birds are the primordial source of all influenza A viruses the ones that have the potential to cause pandemics. However, people rarely become infected directly from aquatic birds. Usually, an intermediate host must be involved. This intermediate host provides the right biological setting for the virus to transform into something that can easily infect a human. And that s where chickens and other farmed animals come in.Most avian influenzas are mild, low-pathogenic i.e., not very lethal viruses. However, once they enter poultry factory farms through insects or workers carrying the virus, for example , they can rapidly mutate into highly-pathogenic very lethal viruses, even over very short periods of time. Since 1990, outbreaks of highly-pathogenic virus subtypes have increased substantially among farmed birds compared with the years prior to 1990 3, 4 . The intensive confinement of birds has been found to facilitate both the increasing frequency and scale of these outbreaks 3, 5 .

2017-01-11 03:36:44.000	What exactly do you mean by the playground is restricted ? The Playground is a very special build of Go. I don t even think it s open sourced, often because while you can t depend on security-by-obscurity you still don t necessarily want to just hand people the source to attack on their own. It s written to prevent people from abusing the playground, so for instance, the os package can t read real files, the time package returns constants for time.Now rather than using the clock, and an arbitrary number of other changes are made to prevent abuse. How many changes it is I don t know exactly, but there s certainly a number of them. But, more importantly, the QA work for such a thing is quite substantial. Many of the changes would also preclude using the playground to investigate the new features for instance, you can t test HTTP2 support on there since you can t open sockets or servers. Presumably updating it would require significant effort, and at the very least, it can t be afforded to make that a blocker for a release.

2018-08-02 16:36:49.000	Once you ve experienced this kind of MMO it is hard to get the same highs from other games.I really, truly, am trying to understand, so please bear with my slowness. I can see how it is really rewarding to find not-bad people in an environment that incentivizes really bad people. I don t see how that makes up for getting into such an environment in the first place, and certainly not why one would follow up the experience by seeking out similar environments.People suck on average, so you want to give them every opportunity and incentive to demonstrate, so that you can find the good people? Note the selection bias - you re finding those people that are both NOT asshats but also interested in an environment that encourages asshats. Perhaps that s more rewarding than my habit of simply not having close friends at all, but it also seems far more punishing. Bland people can be exhausting, but evil people....they bring despair. To be in an environment that cranks up the frequency and demonstration of people getting joy from the misery of others...that sounds like a choice to endure needless pain and suffering. Pause for the irony of submitting that last sentence as part of an online discussion thread I just don t get it. Doubtless just a difference in personal tastes - perhaps someone being a jerk around me bothers me just a tiny bit more, and someone being nice around me thrills me just a tiny bit less - but emotionally I m failing to wrap understanding around your stance.

2023-04-16 19:53:56.000	You didn t need to fix it - I meant what I said. Given the money, the achievements are not that hard.According to people I know who worked at SpaceX, there is a whole layer of management that exists to handle Musk the way you would handle a boy king. They basically insulate him from making any decisions that can really hurt the company. I have heard of one instance where they spent 3 weeks quietly convincing him out of a wrong decision before announcing that he made the other choice once he changed his mind and agreed to it .It doesn t sound like a company that needs such a management layer is getting their ability to accomplish things from the boy king, just the name and the money.AFAICT this management scheme is shotwell s doing, and you should probably credit her for the accomplishments.Also, we re seeing this dynamic play out in electric cars. Once they became economical to make and no, Tesla wasn t really responsible for that , other carmakers are now out-competing them.

For lightweight tasks, the web solved this, though local apps still ran smoother than webapps.

But what I found was to get things to work in a performant way, you d end up with very leaky abstractions. At the core, my thinking is it has to do with everyting coming down to handling on a per tick basis rather than as an event. Maybe I just did things wrong... but this seemed to be the direction you re guided in. If you do try and build a good quaility event model, the performance was terrible.

2021-12-25 05:43:51.000	there isn t an aspect of computing that hasn t been improved by F L OSSMmmm.. I d have to disagree, based on my professional experience. FLOSS hasn t really improved business software. User interfaces, Groupware, Enterprise software, Tax software, Government software, Industrial software, Telecom, POS, EHR, etc. It s hardly ever written as FLOSS because it takes a lot of time and effort, and devs don t find it rewarding to write that stuff in their free time most OSS is written because the developer just needed that code . When there is a FLOSS solution, it s not an improvement over the proprietary alternative.Even in IT , there is a huge dearth of quality FLOSS used to build... anything. There s lots of one-off projects that are good for one thing or another, but very few large robust solutions, and components never seem to mix together unless they have custom integrations to tie them to other systems. Microsoft will forever be the king of Enterprise software integration and business productivity tools, and each industry has its own business software titan. SaaS and PaaS are also more closed-source than open.When there is some FLOSS that does something difficult like video rendering, or running distributed applications, the entire industry uses it. But for the bulk of the business world s needs, often the only solutions are proprietary.

I would like to know a LOT more about the pcie interface between the Pi5 CPU and the custom peripheral controller for instance, but there s zero docs on it outside of kernel sources which are just a bunch of magic numbers and other undiscernable enchantments anyway.

2017-02-14 22:25:29.000	Disclosure - I work at Delimiter Thanks for the recommendation, slot hosting is a good solution if you need to get a disk online with a VPS attached to it.We ve had a lot of people asking how you did this so just to explain Slot hosting 120 year 10 month - that gives you one 3.5 or 2.5 slot to send your disk in. You can aggregate up multiple slots and aggregate the VPS resources into one large VM. This is great for things like ZFS and software RAID. The VM is KVM based. server is this Dual E5420, 16GB RAM, 1TB or 2x500GB HDD 200 year 16.66 month . hosting uses dedicated non-contended CPU RAM Disk resources so you can run Plex directly on it if you have enough slots aggregated to give you the RAM.

It s genuinely a borderline issue, and not because of the science, but because it s almost exactly on the line in which some people consider it to be a disaster and others consider it to be a bit of a nothing burger.As a result, you end up in a situation as described by rgrieselhuber below.Some people think that we need to close e.g. schools to stop coronavirus. Other people think that we need to stop caring so much about coronavirus, so that we can go to e.g. school.The question of whether there s misinformation is almost tangential to the point because there are huge numbers of people who do not doubt official statistics or modelling but also believe that data or those models are not severe enough to require us to stop the world so to speak.I guess my thoughts are that, if we can t even convince each other and from what I can tell neither of us have really fallen for misinformation , what hope is there for the actual vaccines cause 5g nutjobs?

2023-10-26 13:00:08.000	I ve always thought it logical to integrate RAM cpu.Look over the course of history there s often a roughly-fixed ratio between cpu performance RAM bandwidth size , and cpu memory graphics interconnect speed. Any of those factors get too far out of wack, and you ve got a machine with poor bang .GPU integration is old now. Ok I ve read there s a mismatch between silicon processes used for logic like cpu gpu etc and memory? But hey, this is 2023. Chiplets? Stacked dies? Or just do the best with available tech? It s not like there are no ICs that integrate RAM compute.With the right architecture, the memory wall could be mostly a thing of the past. With enough cores on-chip RAM bandwidth, maybe specialized gpu processing wouldn t even be needed anymore? For example
2018-11-26 16:26:35.000	I keep saying this but personally I see bitcoin as a good way to transfer value, nothing else. As soon as you consider it that way, it does solve every issue you got with it.You buy bitcoin You send bitcoin He get bitcoin He sell bitcoin, all that hopefully happens in less than a few hours, to avoid market fluctuation the most.The only wallet is at the exchange, hopefully for them, it s moving quickly too. I am supposed to lay out my entire financial history in a public walletDon t hold bitcoin, you make a wallet, you buy, you send, you scrap the wallet. trade with people who I don t knowCryptocurrencies doesn t solve that, HTTPS solve that, you solve that by trust. Sure the old ways to transfer money require less trust from you because you can always revert it by calling your bank, but then it s the other side that need to trust you and he has much less to works with .

2019-03-27 12:53:39.000	Sure, it s somehow better to think of it this way, but the FACT remains that - however much you might enjoy spending time with a game like this, say in-game --- there s no denying that it REALLY IS a waste of time, since everything about it is totally virtual.

2018-07-26 15:19:44.000	The number of drugs who are linked to a higher chance of criminal behavior due to being intoxicated are rather limited and when it comes to drug related crimes another topic in itself.Someone smoking tobacco, weed or heroin wont just suddenly get the idea, that it would be fun to rob someone.When it comes to heroin, but also other highly addictive substances, the main issue is procurement crime. Which is no wonder if someone is addicted and you look at the street prices. Its not feasible for alot of people to make that kind of money legally. Which is a completely different picture if you look at procurement closer to production cost. Production of something like poppies is as inexpensive as it gets.
2021-04-11 13:00:56.000	It s clear we live under capitalism. Private entities own the means of production and employ largely non-owners to engage in wage labor using those means. The profits accrue to shareholders who often do no actual labor in the enterprise. There is very little economic nationalization, relative to what is possible, in the United States and in the west in general. A couple of examples of minimal nationalization are the Norway and Alaskan oil funds. There is also very little in the way of worker control or profit sharing except at the very top of the economic ladder, for example certain tech companies startups and wall street workers.Libertarian purists eschew the idea of a state putting any limits on markets or enterprises for reasons there are actual reasons, as you can read in their literature, I just don t wish to expound on them , but to argue that any limit on an enterprise somehow makes the system not capitalist is an absurdism.

We aren t starving indentured servants. So we have other options.Why do we develop Prism. We do we develop tools to erode net neutrality. Why do we start hacking at the tools to erase police action before we understand the how and why behind the use of those tools.Maybe its just been a long Sunday.

2014-02-10 21:34:21.000	It s kind of funny because Google really only controls the network of sites their ad spaces are on, the content of the ad you get is controlled by the advertiser or 3rd party ad tech provider.The retargeting ads you speak of Criteo runs a lot of them is generated automatically via these 3rd party ad platforms cookie combined with an API into the advertiser s store feed product photo, description, price, etc. They get a stream of SKUs that you ve looked at and try to get you to pull the trigger.There s nothing to prevent the store from also associating items you ve already bought so you don t get shown something that s irrelevant. My best guess is that it s just easier to not do that.

Not the fully assembled thing.

And that was 7 years ago before they made dealing with all the certificates not insanely annoying. If that s not a low barrier to entry i don t know what is.In a way the barrier has increased recently with a lot of new requirements for apps designing for the notch etc and appstore listings and worrying about privacy policies etc.
2018-08-09 08:22:57.000	I was at a wedding when the question was posted, hence taking forever to reply apologies! .I am of course biased, I want to say that up front. For Uber we wouldn t really want to use Thanos for a few reasons but one primary one is that Thanos is upfront that they don t really optimize for latency with metrics that don t currently reside on disk, which can take significantly more time coming from S3 rather being mmapd on a local disk. We have historical metrics needed for anomaly detection 5 weeks of data queried very frequently and the model of downloading the S3 data for each request or caching it locally which would fill up the disk of query nodes quite quickly, since we have petabytes of metrics data doesn t really scale for us. Also we re conscious of having to pay all the AWS bandwidth costs considering the dataset is in the petabytes and we run things both on premise and cloud.Anyway I could definitely talk at length about this, perhaps we should write up something and put it on our wiki.
2015-09-01 16:48:50.000	PHP breaks things all the time just check the migration guides for any release , but the difference is that they break only what they must, and deprecate things in a timely way so you can evolve your codebase instead of having to rewrite it. Other platforms tend to see a broken piece that needs replacement as a good opportunity to redesign everything else as well, even the stuff that worked fine, and don t put as high a value on easy migration paths.Ofcourse, that s also one of the reasons PHP has so much ugliness still.

2020-03-02 12:51:56.000	What I do is to use multiple search engines and specialize my searches.I use smart keywords 1 , which work similarly to DuckDuckGo s !bangs 2 and most of the time I noticed that I know what the source I want is if I want a Wikipedia article, I search with w in front, if I m searching for a dictionary definition, I search with a define , if I want to search for a location I search with maps , if I want a StackOverflow answer I search with so , etc, etc.I have bookmarks for such search engines, neatly being synchronized between my Firefox instances works on mobile too and I got quite used to them. I prefer my own bookmarks, b c I can always add custom stuff and b c I don t want an extra round trip to DDG anyway.Also DuckDuckGo is fine for English results, I often find that searches yielding bad results on DDG will often lead bad results on Google too. When not finding what I m looking for, sometimes I search on Google too g , in order to double check. But you won t catch me searching for very personal stuff on Google e.g. I ll never search for health advice on Google and even if DDG s results are bad, it s either that versus nothing at all.I m also not super strict we do use Gmail and Google Docs at work and that s fine, but I do prefer native clients for Gmail too and I prefer text files in my Dropbox for my own notes. I also pay for YouTube Premium, because otherwise my son is getting exposed to ads, plus I watch YouTube anyway and I d rather have the ads-free experience on every device I own. 1

These businesses have already suffered greatly under the capacity restrictions of closures. Now they re being asked to turn away potential customers and enforce unpopular rules without compensation, under threat of substantial penalties.If the city wants to impose this rule, then at the very least they should handle the enforcement. Outsourcing the mandate without compensation is absurd.

It s usually politically risky to pass something which only benefits rich people than something which covers the entire state, which just happens to include that high-value property. When a relief or insurance measure is coming up, they re just going to make sure it has no or generous limits and make sure that it goes through.Similarly, tourism related businesses might not be plutocrat-level wealth but they tend to be well-represented politically because they re visible and employ a fair number of people.

2009-08-01 20:40:58.000	Just studying Marxism is an individual act of revolution. The mental impact on one s mind, when you finally get it, is irreversible. Class Consciousness is a revolutionary virus of the mind.Thank goodness for a healthy mental immune system, then. Proponents of Marxist thought seem to believe that because they ve found there s a different way of looking at the world that explains some things better than their default view, it must thus be correct in all respects. Pointing out that one has simply swapped one kind of tunnel vision for another tends to be poorly received. This is not to say the study of Marx is without value, but I m being a lot kinder to Marxism here than Marxists are towards their perceived class enemies .Anyway yes, the reading list is underwhelming. 4 works about Mao, but nothing by Mao himself, or by Che Guevara?

Russians are not helpless. The main argument when this gets brought up seems to be that it s going to be hard and people will get hurt. Of course Putin isn t going to just throw up his hands and say Ok guys, you win, I m out . Nobody is expecting that. But we ve seen that change is possible, and if the Russians are as against Putin s regime as some like to claim they are with some even saying it s _most_ Russians , maybe it s time to actually do something about it. In the end, they re likely the only ones who can.

2022-06-02 03:54:11.000	The impact of this seat scarcity has been higher prices at elite colleges, which has eventually trickled down into higher prices at other schools also. Scarcity of seats leads to systemically higher prices. As we obviously want systemically lower prices, we have to start thinking about reducing the scarcity of seats at elite colleges. But that belies the whole point of elite colleges. They are selling a Veblen good and dilution of the elite brand is not what the consumer of higher-ed wants. They are purchasing elite status.

We ve reached out to dozens of coding tutorial companies, but none want to share their visitors contact information understandably . We ve tried contacting students on our campus and others to find people who ve used tutorials, but few have. If you have ideas about how to contact tutorial users, please share!The even harder problem is measuring learning. There are essentially no reliable, valid measures of any knowledge of programming exams in courses are mostly unreliable, invalid measures .

Does a private, market solution toll roads work sometimes? Sure. Could we build our entire network of roads using tolls. Of course not.In a way this is a bit of a cop out because no one can will up end the entire system.One thought experiment I like to run is what happens to prices if we use to government to subsidize supply of services? Provide free schooling and other government benefits for people willing to train to become medical workers. Take the rural dentist crisis. IMO the government should be training people who live in those communities to become dentists for free.We have limited examples in places like Cuba. I m not saying that full on socialism is a magic bullet, but I think smartly applied it works better for markets like healthcare.

However it is a very small or local market - hobbyists tend to know how to fix them on their own and big businesses get support plans from manufacturers. Not impossible though.The bloom app could be either improved or even pivoted. Quite promising, but unless it becomes a real business or is really the best of is class it can easily be cloned and undercut.The smart watch of this kind litters the Kickstarter for example... and it is too nerdy to scale.Others are random hacks.

2012-01-05 02:21:12.000	In the 1950 s and 1960 s there emerged a fad for giving personality tests to people, and the then train those who passed to become software programmers that would work in a factory.A lot of the really bad practices that hit us with long-term costs come from this era... and a lot of the misconceptions we have about programmers being nerdy anti-social types come from those personality tests, because they didn t test whether you d be a good programmer... they tested whether you would sit in a production line and push buttons repetitively without talking to others.So... no, I don t think that a return to the factory model is the solution. It s been tried and it really did not work. I think that software is big enough of a shift that it warrants removing the traditional business hierarchies and ceremonies of authority, and to create a new model that is not the old factory model.

2024-02-01 17:31:27.000	I have no idea if the author is aware, but it s worth noting why a Markov chain has the name and what the difference is from other probabilistic models. The Markov property states that the probability distribution of the next state in some system depends only upon the current state.Obviously, language does not have this property and this has been known from the start, but Markov models are extremely computationally tractable, easy to implement, and easy to understand, while doing a good enough job. Introducing recursion and recurrent layers into multilayer neural architectures allowed explicit modeling of variable-length past context for the current state, which is a more accurate representation of how language works, but these were quite expensive to train. Transformer models introduced the attention mechanism to simulate recurrence without explicitly encoding it, reducing the training cost to make it tractable to train equivalently capable models with larger parameter sets on larger training sets, giving us the large language model.This ability to explicitly capture variable-length context lookback is what makes things like few-shot and one-shot learning possible. The probability distribution is effectively self-modifying at inference time. It s not quite like an animal brain. There is no true plasticity with the strict separation between training and inference, but it gets a lot closer than a Markov model.You can see in a lot of the comments here about use cases people had for Markov models where they shine. If you re making a bot intended to model one specific topical forum on a single web site, context variance is reduced compared to trying to converse with and understand arbitrary people in arbitrary situations. You re able to capture the relevant context based on how you select your training data. In contrast, current LLMs allow you to train on all text you can find anywhere and the model will perform well in any context.

2019-10-06 18:14:42.000	Counterpoint, as a Model 3 owner.The lack of tactile controls for things like climate controls, sound system, etc., is very frustrating. I find myself having to mess around with the touchscreen much more than I d like while driving. You get used to the central screen in lieu of a traditional dashboard pretty quickly, but I d prefer more traditional dashboard functions to be aligned to display s on the driver s side.I despise the lack of a traditional keyfob or non-phone means of locking unlocking the car other than the awkward keycard only useful through the driver s side .It represents an extremely opinionated way of doing things. If you love life with your iPhone and Apple s extremely opinionated way about how it should work and how you should work with it, the Model 3 gives you something approaching that. Smartphones have their utility, but I m not the kind of person that lives my digital life through one. I therefore have no love for the idea of my car as a roadgoing smartphone. I also couldn t possibly give less of a shit over Autopilot as we are so far away from that technology being rigorous.Interior materials, particularly the carpet, are cheap.There are also significant privacy implications associated with the connectivity, which Tesla does not do enough to address.Things I do enjoy the refreshing minimalism, the styling though body panel alignment still has room to improve , and the energy drivetrain technology. It is definitely enjoyable to drive. Driving our other combustion engine hybrid is a steep step backward into a cruder era.Bottom line Tesla s energy drivetrain technology are years ahead of other manufacturers if that matters to you, there is no current package like Tesla s. I look forward to the time when more traditional auto manufacturers catch up and I have well-engineered choices that don t require me to live with Tesla Elon s opinions on how an EV should work.

2016-01-15 09:01:02.000	That s exactly my thinking about moral and ethical argumentation. If we already share the same values, lucky for us, we have a foundation to build upon. If not, oh well, let s look for areas we can agree upon.I think moral consensus is successfully used when the right historical moment has come along, and the tipping point has come to the old moral majority. Obama has made a similar point in his recent arguments about gun policy, stating that for some issues, there just isn t the moral consensus to do pragmatic work.The likelihood is that one cannot build a bridge across values, and that values are axiomatic. Either you accept them or you don t. But if you built a blockbuster theory that built consensus in the philosophical community, those effects would probably begin to ripple outward. I think that s incredible work.

Hello Enumerators in Ruby and using simple callbacks in node.Speed? Hello V8 for JS. Hello vast speed improvements in MRI, C extensions, or leaning on the speed of the JVM for Ruby JRuby.Broad? Javascript is probably the most widely deployed language on the planet, and by many measures the most used. Ruby trails JS, and maybe Python too, but its still plenty popular. Not to mention the depth of libraries for both is pretty stunning.Javascript is not javascript, ruby is not ruby. There are a number of vastly different and wildly popular JS implementations, and embedding JS in other applications is plenty common. Ruby has MRI CRuby , Rubinius, JRuby which is much more active than Jython , mruby embedded ruby , and opal for compiling ruby into JS, not to mention the heavy ruby influences on CoffeeScript and Sugar.js.The articles points are all valid, but none of them really demonstrate that Python is the answer to the article s thesis question You are looking for a job, which language should you learn? That said, Python is great. I like Python. Just not a big fan of poorly argued fan boy articles.

However, it s the most cited example that gets dragged up in discussions and leads people to think it s the first case of it. None of that is new to Western Civilization though. Many cases, religion was only the pretext for some monetary or status gain by the accuser, but if you look deeper into the Salem Witch Trials, the same goes for them as well.Reformation and Counter Reformation had Protestants and Catholics killing and accusing each other in some of the bloodiest wars of Europe of the time 1 .Middle ages had it with Heretics, Jews, Muslims and sometimes even Roman Catholic versus Orthodox Catholic all accusing and killing each other.Early Christianity, there was pagans versus non-pagans 2 as well as the various sects of Christianity denouncing each other 3 4 .Could go back further, but I think that s enough examples 1
2024-02-05 11:00:16.000	View from a US-expat in the Netherlands It doesn t have to be as bad as it is.Subsidize daycare, fund schools from pre-school to university and focus on learning at-school and not at-home, and pass laws forcing employers to allow parents to reduce their working hours, should they wish to. You can rebuild your cities to be bike able, change gender norms, or change work culture, but honestly the most change will come from the first list.My situation as a parent here On the cost side, recurring costs for after-school daycare 2x week , school contributions field trips , violin lessons and rental, gymnastics classes, and normal clothing purchases are 200 month. Daycare is subsidized and we are lucky that we only need two days, but bumping that up to 3 or 4 would not be insane on the cost side. Baby day care was also subsidized, but can get expensive if you are sending them 5x week... it depends on the parent s income. For us subsidies covered about a third of the costs, but we earned well.The school here takes care of education, with very little homework. It s well-funded, and does not require much extra effort or money from our side. We can be as involved as we want to be.We are able to use only 2x of day care per week because a most employers understand the needs of parents but mostly b by law employers are required to let you reduce your hours to, for example, take care of your kids. We both work a half-day once a week, with another family member helping on the remaining day.While the Dutch will complain about higher education costs, the costs are reasonable. A 4 year study will cost you around 10k in tuition, total. That 4 year study results in a masters if the student is able wants to follow a university track.

Searching with a country state zip alongside the query helps, but it s a kludge that s much worse than actual location-specificity, especially if one is going to an ambiguous place like Portland or Washington. I d very much prefer it if Google offered the same sort of mechanics as weather sites defaulting to my location, then offering a little box saying search as if I m located in . Instead, the only option is use precise location , which is no more helpful than basing location on my IP and history.In this sense, it s the same standard-uses-only paternalism that plagues Android. Maps on desktop has a great feature of leave at or arrive by , which was removed from mobile in favor of a helpful integration that can notify you about when to leave. It s terrible for anyone who wants to check a route for odd travel hours, or even do something as simple as decide when to set an alarm based on likely morning traffic. And so, of course, people have been requesting the more flexible option for years while consistently being told that the existing version is more helpful .Increasingly, this stuff doesn t just bother me on a privacy or information-neutrality level. It s actively damaging, to the point where DuckDuckGo is actually more usable for certain types of search.

You can do this without using a terrible mashup of XML and JavaScript. JSX is far more pleasant to read and write than the native function call syntaxNo, it isn t. XML is both hard to read and write. It s for machines, not humans. Besides that, mixing two languages with two very different syntactic structures together is a recipe for disaster. And besides that, you now need an additional compilation step because it s not plain JavaScript. What works much better is something like Mithril s templating API, which is concise and pure JavaScript.

It s a bad take that only comes from people who ve had the privilege of all of the problems they ve known in life being self-inflicted 1 . That s for the original commenter. The person you re responding to now is engaging in a major moving of the goalposts. Here s what I ve been prone to tell people instead you know how to always get what you want always? It s by wanting what you re going to get.Some people misunderstand this. It s not about settling or doing nothing. It s rather the opposite. It s to get people to go through the process of interrogating themselves about their wants in a way that engages the logical part of their brain which is ultimately most likely to be the thing that leads to working out a path to whatever that want is, so long as it s reasonable to think that they can actually get it. In the extreme case you present Is it unreasonable for me to want to the abuse to stop? The answer, of course, is an emphatic no. There s no need to stop wanting that.In figuring out whether it is reasonable or unreasonable, the question becomes what is required in order to actually get it?1. Example

It refers to the price of calories, not the price of food by weight.You end up with the cheapest calories being lightly processed grains like rice and flour, then you end up with more processed grains like white bread and ramen, then move to things like peanut butter, before hitting junk food. The point is that the cheapest calories aren t exactly healthy.The produce aisle tends to be pretty expensive per calorie, potatoes excepted, since veggies aren t calorically dense, and are sold mostly by weight.

Yes, I think so.Android and most devices started as a direct response to iOS. All the major players saw that iOS was disrupting the market and there was no time left to invent something on their own, so they simply built a clone.From a business point of view the right decision, Microsoft invented a new UI and new devices with Nokia, but it seems they failed, since they were late to the market and to succeed they would have needed a really disruptive idea themselves.Google had the team and skills to invent something that could disrupt iOS, but they decided to copy it instead and in the process wasted all the brain power of the team that probably has the best chance of finding the next paradigm. What a waste of talent to use all those great people for building a clone.

2014-01-27 05:42:49.000	I think you re missing my point. I wasn t trying to say that the ROI would be better on Facebook with a bigger budget though, I guess anything is greater than 0 . I m saying that your budget is too small to make the numbers you re seeing anything else than statistically insignificant luck.Imagine taking a coin toss and trying to figure out whether heads or tails came up more often, but only tossing the coin three times. Imagine you get HHT, and conclude that head is a better bet than tails.This is essentially what you re doing, by concluding that one option is better than the other, based on a single-digit install sample size.Now, I m not saying you should be spending massive ad budgets, and spending a lot of time tweaking your campaigns, I m merely pointing out that you don t have enough raw data to make conclusive judgements about the effectiveness of these two networks.Being a major player in this industry, I can tell you that the numbers I m seeing seem to indicate that Facebook and Chartboost are in fact much more effective ways to buy installs for mobile games than AdMob, with a properly set up campaign. Feel free to contact me directly if you d like more insight regarding this.

2016-09-07 11:09:26.000	This is all from memory, so I may misidentify some factors as important and fail to identify some factors, and my chronology may be wrong.Steam won because it had first mover advantage. Valve was historically a developer, and it launched Steam with a highly-anticipated game, so I suppose it didn t have pre-existing relationships with its retailers to negotiate. Other traditionally to-retail large publishers didn t get into the online distribution and online DRM game till quite a bit later. Meanwhile, the indie gaming scene exploded, and many of them chose to distribute via Steam.As for why it continues to be the most popular platform, I presume that they are mostly due to it s reach as a channel as well as its gamification of its platform to encourage loyalty and spending. I think I should let someone who s seen things from the developer side answer this though.

We don t consider that an axiom today, and we don t understand why, in Greek mathematics, this was considered to require noting, or what exactly it meant to them. They obviously had something in mind when they said this, but we don t know what that was.Thinking of a line as being defined by the 180 degree angle it forms at every point of itself feels like a similar sort of thing to whatever it was that the Greeks were thinking about right angles.

2020-09-27 06:43:34.000	It depends almost entirely on seniority and your relationship to the company. I found that for most IC jobs, once you give your two week notice you immediately lose a lot of the relational power that you previously enjoyed. There is no incentive to take on new projects, so you quickly find yourself out of things to do. Depending on how the company handles your departure, two weeks is either nowhere near enough time or way more than necessary. As you increase in seniority, there are more people who rely on you to get your job done. Therefore the task of finding a replacement and training them is larger, and so more lead time is appreciated. For manager level and above, a month would be ideal if you can swing it. For executive roles, you should ideally be letting your fellow executives or the board of directors know about your departure multiple months in advance.

In RDF, Skolemization amounts to replacing every blank node in a graph by a new name, i.e. a URI reference which is guaranteed to not occur anywhere else. In effect, it gives arbitrary names to the anonymous entities whose existence was asserted by the use of blank nodes the arbitrariness of the names ensures that nothing can be inferred that would not follow from the bare assertion of existence represented by the blank node.SPARQL has UUID and BNODE functions The BNODE function constructs a blank node that is distinct from all blank nodes in the dataset being queried and distinct from all blank nodes created by calls to this constructor for other query solutions. If the no argument form is used, every call results in a distinct blank node. If the form with a simple literal is used, every call results in distinct blank nodes for different simple literals, and the same blank node for calls with the same simple literal within expressions for one solution mapping.Blank node
2019-10-31 17:40:57.000	The bad news for cats? They lack this muscle. As a result, cats stares can look cold and unfriendly, and two cats staring at each other can often be a prelude for fisticuffs. But a slow blinking stare one that your cat probably gives towards you from the other side of the room is something else entirely it s their way of expressing love. Even turning their heads to one side isn t necessarily disdain, but a sign of their relaxation.When I rescued a street cat, the first thing I did was google how to take care of it and understand it. This was many, many years ago. All this information existed a long time ago, and so it s weird to me that people still think that cats are unfriendly. Or are people knowledgeable, but media just likes to make clickbait?I ll forever trust that cats absolutely can be friendly. My cat would come and sleep with me every night, often cuddle up in my lap, and my roommate told me when I went on vacation, my cat would stay all day at the door every day waiting for me to come back. Yeah, I once took care of a friend s cat that was particularly unfriendly. That cat just had a difficult time bonding with strangers. But just because some human being has difficulty interacting with people especially people on the autistic spectrum , I wouldn t label them and certainly not the entire human race unfriendly. Those cats and those humans just have something else going on in their lives and need a different approach, that s all.As a cat guy, these articles do annoy me. Show a cat love, the cat will respond positively. Some cats are high-strung and need certain attention, but that s true for people too. Even my friend s unfriendly cat eventually came around, though it took weeks. Don t label the entire species.
2020-01-29 15:34:35.000	At least in my experience, problems with Linq are problems with optimization. For example, if you have an in-memory collection with 100,000 items, and you do collection.First i i.id 123 , that will be much slower than a dictionary indexed by id. Refactor so you can do collection 123 instead of Linq. Some developers understand this, for other less savvy developers, it s just voodoo. In any case, if the collection is 100 items, there s no real advantage to optimizing.Also, a foreach loop with an if statement is probably faster than a select statement, because it s not allocating a lambda and going back and forth in the stack and a for loop indexed by a counter is probably faster than a foreach loop. Those, however, are micro-optimizations that really need their value shown in a profiler.I once wrote a library that allowed indexing collections by different properties. It was quite intense, and it paid off as the application has lots of RAM-based queries and its internal collections can scale to 20,000 or 250,000 items. Unrelated I wanted to open source the library, but my boss wouldn t let me. Sigh. Maybe I should have pushed back around my annual review that being able to put my name on a useful open-source library is important career development.

It would be nice, and probably safer, if cars could actually communicate with each other, rather than have to rely on their own cameras, to determine another vehicles position. Same with traffic lights, road signs, etc.that s probably a long way off, although i wonder if Teslas have hardware that would allow them to communicate with one another.

Even if Amazon s Oregon data center isn t anywhere near a forest, there are still failure modes that can affect a widespread area. For example, fires can disrupt power lines. They can also result in mandatory evacuations of large areas. They can also cause highways to be shutdown for many days. All of which can impact multiple AZs that are close to each other .

2018-08-31 05:17:48.000	Advance TLDR See previous post from a few months ago or continue below... It s bizarre how many comments here are focusing on traditional white vs. black issues when this is entirely about a non-white group...Actually, it s not bizarre at all. In fact, the long unsettled distraction of black vs. white is entirely what this whole dust-up is about. And while the particular case being litigated involves Asian students, the people group funding the suit are non-Asian, IIRC. In fact, I believe they the funders actually did something of a casting call to find their plantiff s , which isn t altogether uncommon. This case, ties into the previous anti-affirmative action cases that did not deliver the desired death blow. I don t have time or interest really to dig up old articles and such, but you shouldn t have any difficulty validating what I m saying here if you are interested in doing so.Also, there isn t much concern about Asian students who perform well on the requisite tests outnumbering other groups. The concern is about their outnumbering one group. W all due respect, this should be pretty clear to anyone who understands the historical mission s -- which aren t all that different from those of current-- of such elite institutions. It s even clearer if one reads a little history of the schools or broader society, your choice .With respect to your question s about institutional racism, I m not sure if you ask in earnest or are being rhetorical, so I beg forgiveness in advance. The simple fact of the matter is that the whole issue consists of many moving parts and circumstances. You say Asian , but who are we even really talking about? That s a pretty diverse population. And it doesn t consist solely, or even mostly, of superior performers. All of the dysfunctions that many like to label as being exclusively Black or maybe Hispanic can easily be found among Asians , too. And we still haven t even gotten to talking about which Asians from Asia are here and how they got here, or why. What are these Asian applicants supposed to do...1 Question whether their understanding of admissions criteria is correct If they believe that their understanding of the admissions criteria is correct I don t believe that it is based on personal experience inside knowledge and research , and they believe that they meet the criteria for admission, then...2 Start asking some very tough questions about why the bar is lower for everyone else or3 Opt out and do their own thing instead of seeking validation from, and validating, a system that for whatever reason s doesn t seem to value them appropriately.Again, the entire issue is pretty complex, far more so than I ve ever seen anyone here make it out to be. Which is why I hope you ll actually check out the video in the linked post.
2022-01-05 00:03:51.000	Even today s self-described enlightened societies draw a distinction between the lawful killing of the children of enemy nations as unavoidable consequences of war and the unlawful killing of children by their own parents at least once those children are outside the womb .Unfortunately, at the time of the Canaanite cities, there wasn t really much infrastructure for providing welfare services to war orphans, and there was a very real risk that young males of conquered peoples would grow up to seek genocidal revenge on their conquerors. By that standard, offering homes to the female prisoners of war was relatively compassionate.

2011-07-25 00:45:13.000	Current law provides a range of options to protect society, he says. It would be horrible if they started repealing laws and taking those options away. This quote also disturbed me, but for a slightly different reason The prosecutor who is speaking is implying that the large number of laws give him a lot of options, i.e., he is almost free to persecute on whim. If there were fewer laws, he would be more constrained, have fewer options.The whole point of written law is to prevent government from prosecuting on whim. A written law forces government to use objective standards. Yet when there are so many laws that everyone is guilty, the effect is the same as when there are no laws prosecutions are conducted on whim aka police and prosecutorial discretion .

2022-03-22 23:29:37.000	In the same way Apple has started to listen to users regarding their computer feature set they need to do the same for monitors, especially if they want to charge a premium. They make it hard to justify for anyone that uses a Mac anything, which is honestly probably most people in the market for a 1,600 monitor. I have Mac, PC and gaming consoles at my desk. Do I buy a separate 1,600 monitor for my Mac and another monitor for everything else? Even if you take money out of the equation there are space considerations.So here is what I think Apple should add if they ever want to get serious 1. An HDMI 2.1 port.2. Basic Windows and Linux support3. AppleTV built in. If you are going to add an a14 you might as well use it for something I have this fantasy that they will unveil a 24 inch consumer targeted monitor introducing this feature . You then add the ability to use this as a nice small tv or computer monitor, but they will probably never do it.4. For 1,600 it should really be 120hz or higher, but I imagine if they do introduce this the Pro Display XDR will get it first.

Or at least that s one way to describe it, though it might also equally describe other things. so how does screen do that?It s screen s native model. C-a split -v splits side-by-side and C-a S split splits top-and-bottom. Screen calls these regions . C-a X remove will remove the current region, letting the sibling take the entire space again. C-a Q only will replace the entire layout with the current region. C-a tab focus will jump to the next region it can take directional arguments to move up, down, left, and right, as well as prev to go the opposite way of next , but these are not bound by default .What tmux users would normally think of as window changing commands just switch the current region in the layout between viewing the entire pool of running commands.

Crypto currencies weren t intended to free people from every constraint of society, just a few constraints, and only to a degree.Crypto clearly has the potential to make enforcing trade and currency restrictions far more difficult. When it s too difficult to enforce a rule, governments can 1 stop enforcing it or 2 ratchet up the penalty when someone does get caught as a deterrent. The second option can lead to unpopular disproportionate punishment, and slowly melts away towards the first one e.g., war on drugs .Crypto-currency won t take down governments, especially overnight, but they clearly have a long-term potential to alter some levers of power.

2020-03-24 13:01:08.000	Per the linked article, the London civilian populace was widely equipped with gas masks. A chemical weapon would thus cause fewer fatalities than you might expect.A 1,000 lb bomb falling on an apartment building, however, would definitely have a significant death toll.Keep in mind that the total civilian casualty count on the British side during the Battle of Britain was 43k dead and 139k wounded, all from conventional explosives. Those are substantial figures. It s not clear how chemical weapons could have ever remotely killed as many, because after the first few successful attacks the gas masks would be emphasized even more, and everyone would be carrying theirs with them everywhere they went, ready to don at a moment s notice. As the article points out, you can armor even a civilian populace against chemical weapons relatively easily, but you can t armor a city against high explosives.
2020-12-29 17:23:15.000	What seems to be missing from this discussion is that this agreement was negotiated mind bogglingly quickly 9 months as opposed to the multi year decade long process and hasn t undergone the usual process of scrubbing which is where such technical and legal issues would normally be fixed. This process would itself normally take longer than the entire period in which this has been negotiated. Of course it s a mess and is full of copy-pasta errors. Luckily however law isn t code, especially not at the international agreement level, and it is implemented by humans, not computers or software developers . The big problem with the Brexit deal is that it has essentially come straight from the hands of the politicians and civil servants who have negotiated it and is then being approved without proper scrutiny, at least from the UK parliament and the council of Europe. Let us hope that the only problems with it are a few embarrassing technical errors that in reality will be dealt with by secondary legislation and side agreements between the parties. If there are serious issues then they will likely be picked up before it is approved by the European Parliament and it s not a shoe in that it will actually be approved by MEPs and these will need to be dealt with, probably through a bunch of secondary legislation and agreements.

It s also easy to do TLS wrong in OTP, so I recommend watching all of Bram Verburg and Ingela Anderton Antin s videos first.the socket library if I am correct is the beginning of redoing the entire network stack in a way that is more commensurate with the way that typical programmers expect but with the right erlang-ey . Allow underscores in numeric literals to improve readabilityThis is great whenever a language does it. The embedded documentation is created as docchunks EEP 48 It looks like the erlang community is converging on the elixir strategy for documentation. This is fantastic, since elixir documentation is quite good, and it shows that the two languages are starting to put their friendly animosity aside and really working together. distributed named process groups is introducedThis is kind of huge.

There may have been more limited strikes in March and April, but the Rafah offensive started, we can no longer claim so. Israel is doing large scale strikes in most of Gaza, including Rafah.

2024-02-20 00:02:21.000	Target is was pretty bad about this.As of 2007 daytime backroom staff had to pick n items within a 2 hour window, every 2 hours, 3-4 times per shift. There d be ad hoc forklift requests for toilet paper or patio furniture from the rafters which interrupted scheduled work, but in general it was doable by the 1 person they d schedule back there. If you got done early, you were supposed to backstock items that didn t fit on the sales floor. Cutting every corner and being uninterrupted one person could do 2.5 hours of projected work in 1.75 and have 15 minutes to spare .At some point after 2007 they changed it to a series of 1-hour batches. In addition to ad hoc requests you also had to wait for a manager to let you into the electronics cage, the pharmacy cage, and the overflow shipping containers out back during summer winter-- every hour. The time targets were physically impossible to keep up with since you now had to cover the same amount of ground twice as often. Pissing in bottles wouldn t even have helped there was plenty of time to use an actual toilet while waiting on keyholders to show up.So where once employees were afforded leeway to manage enough time to get a task done, corporate shortened the window arbitrarily which also generated additional backstock every hour instead of every 2 , ran everyone ragged and made it impossible to meet goals, ever. Seeing that my chances of getting merit raises beyond that point were tanked, I fucked off.Insidious indeed.

It might be germane if 1 his behavior demonstrated that he was particylt untrustworthy on this topic and 2 fact claims were being made that could only be accepted based on trusting Thiel.It might also be germane if we were discussing the credibility of his claim to believe in the position he lays out rather than the merits of that position this is actual a special case of the preceding. It s also potentially useful as a filter as to whether it s worthwhile to both considering his opinions and participating in the discussion in the first place many fallacies are pragmatically useful in terms of whittling down the universe of ideas to decide which one are more likely to ve worth spending more time analyzing.

2015-02-12 02:41:31.000	I m also part of the problem. I teach one course a year. So it s far from a fulltime thing. The pay is about 100 per hour OF LECTURE. Considering the prep time needed, and the mandatory unpaid interaction with students after hours, it probably works out to 10-15 hour. I m part of the problem because I don t much care about the money. I teach because it impresses my clients, which brings me more realworld consulting work.Let s do the math for the last lecture I taught. 30 students pay about 900 each to take my class. That s 27K. But I also know half of the school s budget comes from the province ie government support . So let s double that to say 50K, of which I take home 4 ... 8 to the instructor and the rest to the admins.I think the real issue is the larger move towards academic admin as a separate profession from teaching. None of my four bosses have ever taught a class. Law schools are probably the last vestige of the old system whereby most admins are senior profs, not professional administrators.

2018-08-19 07:28:08.000	That is an interesting point, kind of on the edge I guess. If Facebook really wanted to do the right thing while allowing this kind of multi-targeting, they should then build something such as segments in the same campaign.You want to target only a specific group that, under the law, can t be targeted avoided? Fine, but then you have to create at least 3 segments on this ad to target at least 3 different groups, to prove that you are not discriminating.A segment would be a version of the ad design, copy, etc targeted group.edit my point here is that it should be Facebook s responsibility to make it difficult for publisher to post illegal ads, not the other way around.
2022-09-02 16:25:53.000	If this is a real concern for you, I think the real problem isn t the technology -- it s you.Maybe you re right. I think always-connected wearable technology can hurt autonomy.On one extreme, a strict parent could use this to obsessively track their kid, notify them when they should be home, and use their logged history for whatever reason. Maybe a kid dreads wearing the thing because of their parents.On another extreme, a lax parent could not give a damn about their kid and just wants the peace of mind that they could if they wanted. Maybe a kid doesn t mind wearing it.The introduction of wearable technology here adds similar challenges that smartphones do Do kids behave differently if they know they can be A accessible at anytime B located at anytime C history logged at all times?Does that cause them to make different decisions than they would otherwise with no technology? That is what I mean by losing autonomy at the cost of parental kid peace of mind.Trust between your kids is most important, but technology is a factor here too.

Heck, even relatively simple specialist interventions will go beyond coverage.In many countries they are great at routine care, no doubt, as they re just not overcrowded and that is the main reason for problems in public systems. If you shift all the crowd there... well... they degrade much quicker and worse than public.So, apples to apples. Fully public vs fully private systems.You could say compare German system with US system which are almost completely mirror images except German one is many times cheaper.

2007-08-29 19:16:13.000	There is an interesting group of ideas around intelligence, education, credentialism, and signaling.Getting a degree is a sign that you are smart enough to get a degree. Getting one from a good school is that much better. The biggest loss if you learned the exact same material on your own outside a university is that others aren t signaled that you ve received that education.If you build something good, it doesn t matter where you are. People know you re smart from what you ve done.There are millions of people paying for a credential that means less as more people get it. Companies treat college degrees as a sign that you re not a total failure.It would be nice if there were better tests for ability. They work for things like the SAT II, but I can t imagine an accurate test for post-graduate ability besides a review of what you ve made.But companies are lazy. They don t have the time or money to really look at the quality of most candidates, so they use signaling tools as filters.

2016-12-16 02:39:52.000	You misunderstand the EMH. It doesn t say that the average investor is rational. In its weak form it says that it s very, very hard to beat the market.Imagine you are an average VC. You lose money. You lose money because the market means Sequoia and other top tier firms get first refusal on all the best deals. Also you are overwhelmingly likely to be a fairly useless investor. If you are a great investor you can set up a top tier VC fund based on your own investing history. See Andreesen Horowitz.Likewise in the stock market, bond market, every market but the process happens faster the more open, transparent and liquid it is. If you can achieve a 30 year on year return people will happily lend you money or invest with you. Most people are just lucky or their advantage disappears at some point. But some people really are just that good and they either reach a size where they can t get above average returns any more because their strategy doesn t work at that scale, Apple, Berkshire Hathaway or they deliberately stay smaller than they could be to keep their money spigot working, Renaissance, Citadel.

If you re worried the company has a doc floating around with crude jokes - but they stopped it ... and you want to restructure the company in your social terms because you think there s something existential at foot ... you re going to be fired.Even if the tone was off, the company acted within reason.

2023-05-01 18:37:37.000	For a living, I influence high level corporate strategy in the games industry. I ve consulted for all the biggest companies in the space, including all the tech giants various gaming-related groups.Let me be abundantly clear the decision is utter nonsense. I m not going into the details here, but the decision is an abysmal abomination and should be very concerning to all technology businesses, both because it signals that a relevant regulatory body is willing to make arbitrary and horribly-justified decisions with major material impacts, and because a story is emerging about the international regulatory collusion that drove this. It ABSOLUTELY IS an undemocratic power grab from politically-driven regulators that abrogates their core duties in favor of empowering themselves and their own political factions.Additionally, it s extra embarrassing for the UK because it signals an overly cozy relationship with Sony which has more operations employees in country that reeks of regulatory capture by a local lobby. That and a willingness to jump through hoops for an ambitiously activist US FTC. Unfortunately, the net result is the UK coming off as a complete joke. I m strongly advising clients to avoid expanding operations in the country and to genuinely consider abandoning the market.Take it or leave it, but I write this all as someone who had otherwise been strongly arguing AGAINST the deal, because I think it s bad for the games industry. But this kind of sloppy and arbitrary behavior from regulators is even worse, for all gaming and tech businesses and, to some degree, for all business in general.Edit- I can t elaborate on my reasoning here, but the full picture is out there for anyone interested in looking into it. This is a long and thorough rundown of the situation that serves as a good starting point

2015-08-10 19:17:07.000	My impression from the article wasn t an objection to hackers making money per se indeed, most of the original hackers , back in the days of Lisp machines and ITS and early Unix, were - if not academics - professional, paid programmers , but rather an objection to the characterization of hackerdom as a collective conformance to multi-million-dollar companies and investors in Silicon Valley rather than its proper to the author characterization as individual resistance to such collective conformance.The article misses the mark here mostly because it swings a bit too hard toward crackeresque antisocial anarchy in order to compensate for the Valleyesque prosocial conformity being criticized. Really, the hacker ethos leans closer to asocial ambivalence.

This kind of flag would affect every site they crawl. I feel like it s much more likely that it was made to prevent some class of abusers, and you were caught up in the scope of their net.I mean, every time they make a change in ranking some people get hurt and some people get helped. If this is a universal change and not tied to your domain I have a hard time believing that a team would ve added this flag because a former employee makes a competing site with a slightly different model from you.
2017-12-07 23:09:18.000	Right now it d probably be a net positive to the economy. Many of the people who were in early and have made paper millions weren t all that rich before and just happened to get lucky, while the money that s cashing them out now is largely coming from wealthy people institutions that don t want to be left behind. Redistribution from rich - poor is usually an economic plus, because it shifts cash from people who have a tendency to sit on marginal dollars to people who have a tendency to spend it.This could reverse if the average man on the street starts investing significant amounts of money, enough that they d miss it if it evaporated. Then we d get a big recession when the bubble popped.

But at the same time pilots should have protections to make them feel safe from retaliation.Aviation safety is an incredible achievement that we as technologists should learn from.

Certainly, you can t do that with client-side JS, but could you imagine mixing desktop-side JS and C in the view?That said, the piece that is in most need of performance in a desktop application is often the GUI itself. Imagine Microsoft Word taking a split second more when it updates the ribbon, for example.Perhaps there is an exception for desktop apps that need direct connections to hardware.

You re absolutely right that reading emotional appeals online is a slippery slope.However, reading this Business Insider article about the case really underscores the apparent sleaze on Smule s side You compare a 100-person company with 10, 30, 40 million dollars in the bank to a two-person startup. If it goes to litigation, if we re wrong, we ll win. Right? We ll win. We ll put a giant law firm on it and we ll do all of the discovery and we ll do all the depositions and we ll win. And if we re right, we ll still win.Pretty much no matter how you slice it, saying even if we re wrong, we ll win because of money in the bank sounds pretty awful.

2013-05-26 00:54:09.000	White Americans love their weed. As a young Latino growing up in the ghetto it was hammered into my head that If I wanted to be successful I had to stay away from drugs and alcohol. And in the ghetto this correlation turns out to be very true since pretty much all losers do drugs and drink a lot.Then I went to a state college and went to work in corporate America after graduation. To my surprise I realized that the majority of white American kids do weed and drink lots of alcohol. It made me realize that because they are middle class white Americans it means that they can afford to do stuff like that and still come out ahead compared to somebody in the ghetto.In the ghetto, if you want to move ahead you cannot really afford to waste your time with weed or alcohol. You are already behind in your education level probably because of the crappy school system in your neighborhood so you do not want to add another problem to an already problematic situation.It took me a long time to realize this.

I need to capture the failure logic and make appropriate ui changes. There are 4 types of errors and they require doing some library logic to figure out what to display.But wait! I want to wait 250ms before triggering any state updates, or else the ui transitions will feel buggy.Oh, and product now wants to make sure we capture some random third party tracking event in between specific state changes. The ui MUST NOT change until the tracking call succeeds.This and more is trivial in redux saga, and you can write tests around it.

2016-04-17 22:25:25.000	Julia breaks down the second wall the wall between your high-level code and native assembly ... you can take a peek behind the curtain of any function into its LLVM Intermediate Representation as well as its generated assembly code all within the REPLWhile I agree with the author in betting on Julia , I do not think inspecting LLVM IR or assembly of individual functions in the REPL is as useful as a feature as the author thinks, because it gives an inaccurate picture of what the actual output will be.Peeking at the code at the level of functions means a non-inlined version of the function must be produced at the REPL, and anywhere else this function is used in your actual code, it will probably be inlined the author s example certainly will so it can be further optimized eliminated by later passes. Furthermore, for a non-trivial function s dump, fundamental optimizations that increase code size inlining, unrolling loops etc would make the output confusing to compare with the Julia equivalents.Thus, I imagine a lower optimization level is used to produce readable REPL dumps. For a performance minded person the only type of person who would care about ASM LLVM dumps at a REPL even this is not helpful.

However, when I put together regular expressions, I use new features by trial and error at first, and this is quite like a game. Try it, press u, edit and try again, press u. That s a feedback loop, as in the game just turn-based instead of real-time. lisp python ruby bash etc REPLs are similar.

The quoted number is the height of a layer that the settings shipped with the printer are good for, not the precision or accuracy of the print head. The X, Y, and Z resolution, as well as the extruder step size on a Solidoodle and almost any other printer these days is plenty good to print .1mm layers. The challenge in printing .1mm layers is that you re depositing a very tiny amount of plastic onto each layer, so variation like filament quality and moisture, temperature, and speed matters a lot more.Check out RichRap trying out different resolutions layer heights on his MendelMax printer with a Wade s extruder here to learn more about how layer heights work

If you are upper-middle class in Sweden you have a lot of freedom that upper-middle class people in the US don t necessarily have.In Sweden you can study cost-free. You can get a second, or third, degree from reputable school, even online. That makes it easy to change careers or to stay competitive.If you are established in Sweden you are going to have very high financial security and low living costs. Almost anyone that is upper-middle class in Sweden can take a year off to, say, start a business without any major consequences.Just in general upper-middle class people in Sweden have a lot more quality of life and time. 40 hour weeks, employment protection, flat hierarchies, short commute, long vacations, summer homes etc.I personally have nothing against people moving to the US. Especially if you are middle-class and in your twenties it can be a good idea. But as soon as you have kids your costs are going to rise significantly, your opportunities are going to decrease or both.I would be interesting to hear what you think is better in the US for someone upper-middle class.

You speek with the front of your mouth whereas english is more about the back of your mouth.Can you provide some examples of French words that are formed in the front of the mouth that you find difficult to pronounce? English is my native language and I don t speak French, but some of my coworkers do and they occasionally teach me words and phrases. I find it to be the opposite of what you ve described in that the most difficult words for me are formed at the back of the tongue mouth, particularly words containing r like quarante-trois the number 43 . I remember that word because I was out to lunch with one of my French speaking coworkers and I asked him how to pronounce my order number in French. We both had a good laugh as I struggled to say it without sounding like I was choking.However, I studied Spanish from middle school through college, and I ve noticed that English speakers tend to have difficulty with rolling their r s, which is done in the front of the mouth. Are there French words that have this type of pronunciation too? If so, I understand what you mean about the front of the mouth.

Sounds great in theory, you can get rid of the CORBA and GUI modules, that should save you a lot of disk space. In practice the CORBA module is only 2.7 MB and the desktop module is 14 MB and almost every framework indirectly requires the desktop module because Java Beans are in there.

Sure there are glorified POCs of things that could potentially lead in the direction of real world use cases.But most of these products tokens are just extremely meta. Tokens you get paid pay for when you trade borrow lend invest stake your other tokens. Derivative tokens which allow you to get exposure to underlying tokenX on chainY.The transactions are slow, or fast.. cheap or expensive, good luck understanding which in advance.It doesn t feel like we are any closer to normal people using it for normal real world transactions finance.Right now it just feels like pump dump frontrunning private placement games on each new token before it hits mainstream, completely nothing to do with what the alleged business behind that token is supposed to be doing or its prospects of success. It s just a game of getting hold of difficult to acquire tokens before they hit the more normie venues like Binance, Coinbase, etc.
2019-08-20 14:46:38.000	I ve been using Bitbucket with Mercurial repositories since 2011, both for private and public repos. I can count more than 50 mercurial repos that I ll need to manually move somewhere else. I m really disappointed right now. I can understand their motives but they need to provide a single click method to at least convert a repo to git this is a MUST IMHO .I love mercurial but also can see that the community is shrinking, mercurial still relies on Python 2.7, and we are approaching to the EOL of Python 2.7. TortoiseHG also suffers from this, and the release cycle is always out of sync with the hg releases, and this breaks thg. These little things shows the sad state of mercurial, and in the end, this will drive most of the developers away from using it.I guess it was great while it lasted... now, Bitbucket, please provide the developers the right tools to move away from mercurial with celerity.

Not impossible at all. All they will have to do is indicate third party tracking in the App description and present an opt-in dialog.But apparently, this option of letting users decide appears to be literally inconceivable. Under the new rules ...it will no longer be possible to use them . No rhetorical device is too contrived to direct the responsibility to Apple rather than the people actually choosing not to enable tracking - users.

Strike.It might not remain legal to strike for this set of workers on this occasion .On several occasions, Congress has intervened to delay or prohibit strikes. For example, in 1994, Congress passed P.L. 103-380, which extended the final cooling-off period by four months to allow the United Transportation Union and the Soo Line Railroad to continue negotiations. In 1970, P.L. 91-226 imposed a tentative agreement ratified by three unions but rejected by a fourth, similar to H.J.Res. 100.

2023-05-12 14:14:38.000	One of the neat linguistic things still in English from the Norman conquest - the word for the meat in English which is traced back to German is often the word for the animal in French.Meat from cattle is beef. Steer in French is beof From Middle English beef, bef, beof, borrowed from Anglo-Norman beof, Old French buef, boef ox Meat from a chicken is poultry. Chicken is poulet in French. From Middle English pultrie, from Old French pouleterie, from poulet, diminutive of poule hen , from Latin pullus chick . Meat from a swine is pork. The word for swine in French is porc. From Middle English pork, porc, via Anglo-Norman, from Old French porc swine, hog, pig pork , from Latin porcus domestic hog, pig . This is because when the normans who were the rulers at the time wanted poulet on the table, they didn t want a live chicken - they wanted a cooked chicken and so the word the meat and the animal diverged in English.There are also some interesting Spanish Arabic word pairs from where the word in Spanish differs from the romance side of the family tree.

Second, because you could be attributing all your success in doing it to your self, hard work etc, overlooking all the random and lucky elements not to mention other people s work that helped you to achieve that. That s a very common psychological fallacy no winner believes in luck , and one can have it even for minor achievemnets.That is your own projection, and actually shows flaws in your own thinking. I have never claimed this to be true. Also, since you re so interested in fallacies, you should be able to spot your own. So let s stick to observation on how many of those companies were made as non-billion dollar company creators , and arguments that appeal to logic, law, how society works, etc.You are a severely confused person. Some humans, in some domains, some of the time, apply logical thought, and that sometimes produces results. You want a logical argument? Humans are not robots and they do not interact with the world simply using logic and no law describes how society works. Logic means nothing in the domain we re discussing. How a billion dollar company is made, is not some provable hypothesis.

Take the exhaust from the burnt waste and fractionally distill it to extract the Nitrogen, CO2, water and other safe gasses. Take the ash and extract things that are worth money metals , then vitrify the rest turn it into glass Take everything else and stick it back into the input, letting it go round again and becoming something safe this time.1 ton of household waste probably only makes 5kg of vitrified glass - turns out nearly everything in your house is carbon, hydrogen and oxygen.I suspect the energy in all the waste makes this process free from an energy standpoint. But obviously the capital cost of a plant big enough for the worlds waste is huge, and unless laws are written to ban landfills and regular incineration, it would never make financial sense.

2020-06-01 01:26:15.000	was the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich. More than 13,000 people were arrested, including Jan Kubiš girlfriend Anna Malinová, who died in the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp. First Lieutenant Adolf Opálka s aunt Marie Opálková was executed in the Mauthausen camp on 24 October 1942 his father Viktor Jarolím was also killed. 52 53 According to one estimate, 5,000 people were murdered in the reprisals. 54 In February 1944, the SS Division Das Reich was stationed in the Southern French town of Valence-d Agen, 1 north of Toulouse, waiting to be resupplied with new equipment and fresh troops. Following the Allied Normandy landings in June 1944, the division was ordered north to help stop the Allied advance. One of its units was the 4th SS Panzer Grenadier Regiment Der Führer . Its staff included regimental commander SS-Standartenführer Sylvester Stadler, SS-Sturmbannführer Adolf Diekmann commanding the 1st Battalion and SS-Sturmbannführer Otto Weidinger, Stadler s designated successor who was with the regiment for familiarisation. Command passed to Weidinger on 14 June. 2 Early on the morning of 10 June 1944, Diekmann informed Weidinger that he had been approached by two members of the Milice, a collaborator paramilitary force of the Vichy Regime. They claimed that a Waffen-SS officer was being held prisoner by the Resistance in Oradour-sur-Vayres, a nearby village. The captured officer was claimed to be SS-Sturmbannführer Helmut Kämpfe, commander of the 2nd SS Panzer Reconnaissance Battalion also part of the Das Reich division . He may have been captured by the Maquis du Limousin the day before. On 10 June, Diekmann s battalion sealed off Oradour-sur-Glane and ordered everyone within to assemble in the village square to have their identity papers examined. This included six non-residents who happened to be bicycling through the village when the SS unit arrived. The women and children were locked in the church, and the village was looted. The men were led to six barns and sheds, where machine guns were already in place. snip Several days later, the survivors were allowed to bury the 642 dead inhabitants of Oradour-sur-Glane who had been killed in just a few hours. Adolf Diekmann said the atrocity was in retaliation for the partisan activity in nearby Tulle and the kidnapping of an SS commander, Helmut Kämpfe.

2017-01-17 19:15:11.000	My take it s a human means of systematically exploring implications of already accepted beliefs.There are implicit and explicit forms of it.The implicit form is something our brains do automatically and is a consequence of its structure. Perhaps the way it models things intrinsically does not allow for what we would call contradicting statements though it contains many separate models which if unified would contain contradictions then, the space of desirable implications is narrowed by a motivation to find a certain kind of implication i.e. there is typically a goal when engaging in reasoning we aren t often indifferently interested in all implications combined with the fact that contradictions aren t allowed. It seems like implications are usually discovering that some entity belongs to a class it wasn t previously known to belong to, at which point it inherits the attributes of other things in that class.The explicit forms seem like attempts to model the implicit form in mathematical language, in order to bring logical processes more under control of conscious thought, or executive function plus reasoning on paper extends working memory . It seems possible that with the correct formulation, a logic could viewed as a theoretical science describing properties of the structure of the human brain that give rise to reasoning.

And there are better society functioning countries than Germany, at much lower tax rate. Not every tax rate is fair. Some tax rates are unethically high b c due to a overloaded govt. apparatus.
2022-06-24 14:40:09.000	Seriously, this meme about blockchains being uncensorable needs to die.Agreed. Cabals of crypto exchanges maintain blocklists of wallets. Eth did a hardfork to recover the stolen DAO money. Most blockchains mempools are an unincentivized piece of infrastructure that if not properly decentralized could censor transactions.In fact voting on hard and even soft forks is a form of blockchain transaction censorship. Every node miner validator walletapp every actor in the system - decides whether a transaction is legal. Not to mention most if not all crypto is incapable of running a full node or whatever is necessary for full network participation on phones, so if you are using crypto for mobile transactions you re probably talking to an intermediary API that can censor your transaction.For most users, crypto has can be functionally censored by a wide range of actors.

2012-05-15 15:40:32.000	I wanted to add this to my original post because I think it sums up my point nicely That which interests us in a given situation, that which we are likely to grasp in it first, is the side by which it can respond to a tendency or a need. But a need goes straight to the resemblance or quality it cares little for individual differences. To this discernment of the useful we may surmise that the perception of animals is, in most cases, confined. - Bergson from Matter and MemoryConstraints on what we broadly know and understand are constraints on our contact and perception of the world. We can t live in a digital world and be blind to the recursions and graphs in the furniture.

To be in it you have to have an inflated sense of your possibility of success, but to have said success you nonetheless have to be in it, so anyone who makes it is going to be a person with somewhat unrealistic reasoning, but since there s no feedback loop they never get the message that their reasoning was unrealistic.

The Hyperloop, as proposed, would compete primarily with airplanes because it s so much faster than other ways of getting between those two cities. Between Boston and NYC, the link I d most likely take, the Acela is only marginally faster than the Regional. The improvements planned in CT look like they would help, but actually cut similar amounts of time off the two routes.
2023-09-23 14:50:55.000	I don t have much skin in the game, not being a web developer, but something I find intriguing about WASM is the possibility for JS to merely become one of many possible languages to use instead of being the end-all-be-all language of the web. That is, WASM being a successor to JS insofar as being the primary runtime, instead of being dependent on JS.I would assume this is the direction WASM is trying to go? It sounds so much cleaner, and it does seem the DOM being limited to JS is one of the showstoppers.

In fact the top-layer airflow moves faster than the bottom layer, and arrives at the trailing edge sooner.

The old 20th century style of propaganda was mostly ineffectual. The modern tactic of flooding public discourse with bullshit is much more effective. At some point people concede that maybe the shills and useful idiots working for the dictators do raise some valid points, so who knows what to believe.

In general, where you want to install more software than the user already has installed, it should be an optional module or prompted. Without that I wouldn t use this script for that reason alone. - some people have a purpose in using firewire and USB. Make it an option my example high end studio cameras - consider reviewing and the release notes for the version of OpenSSH you are configuring. I wouldn t use your configuration. - why ask how many users to enforce diskquotas on and then ask for which user to enforce a disquota on? Simpler would be to read etc passwd or count home , provide a list to mark and then do it.

2017-03-30 15:51:03.000	Developers, on average, don t even use the free tools.I mean, speaking as one of the 1 who fully voluntarily uses these sorts of tools and can generally only get free ones either because the price is prohibitive for the expensive ones, or I m working in languages that expensive ones don t exist for , I think you re all bloody loonies for not doing it too. Offload to the tools everything you can, to save your precious brain cycles for the stuff that matters. Makes you look like even more of a hero. The excuse I see all too often that by doing that you ll atrophy your own judgment is, by the way, itself just proof you ve never used these tools, or at least not used them properly. If you use them frequently, i.e., at commit-time, rather than quarterly-release time, they train you by telling you what you did wrong, and you learn how to write better code that meets their criteria fairly quickly. They make you a better programmer. These things should be used early and often I m sure a lot of the reasons people tend to not enjoy using them is that they want to write a quarter million lines of code without ever consulting the tool, then run it once at the end. That is a terrible plan. The tool will scream bloody murder and especially in C you are very likely to discover that your entire architecture is fundamentally impossible to fix now, making it very discouraging. Use the tools early and often. Seriously, as soon as you ve created the new project and have hello world going, hook up the tools. They both provide more value and are way easier to use that way.

2024-08-04 21:02:11.000	Hmm, not sure, I think it would be possible to mark a function with a pragma as constant time , and the compiler could make sure that it indeed is that. I think it wouldn t be impossible to actually teach it to convert branched code into unbranched code automatically for many cases as well. Essentially, the compiler pass must try to eliminate all branches, and the code generation must make sure to only use data-constant-time ops. It could warn fail when it cannot guarantee it.

2023-06-19 13:27:32.000	One question I have is, when you say multiple apps, are you speaking in a sense of they are at all related? Or every small app project you have related or not?If you think that people will want to subscribe to more than one app, or if you think you ll want to be able to have a single view of customers users across multiple apps, that s when I d extract auth to an auth server. You can use a dedicated auth server or have other apps rely on one app which uses a library framework.Think of it as normalizing user profile info. Just like when you normalize data, you get wins one place to change things, consistent data structure and you lose things more complex, have to do joins across tables or in the auth case, use tokens .If you don t ever forsee the need to look across all your users, or for users to log into multiple apps, and you don t need some of the isolation and features an auth server can offer, then it makes sense to continue to silo each set of user data in each app.You can always make the investment to migrate to an auth server later. Of course, the longer you wait, the more hairy it will be.Hope that helps, and thanks for the shout out to FusionAuth.

Some example You can t not communicate. So even not persuading is persuading. What if the presidential candidate would just not give a scheduled speech? How do you communicate information objectively? Casual language creates bias, so does scientific language, simple language, passive language, active language. Cognitive Bias might as well be called Cognition , since it is just how the brain works. You have to think tree immediately when you see one, even before you validated that all leaves are real and that the whole thing is not a projection on an transparent screen. Otherwise you can t function.But Big tech throws us in a situation where a small group of people influences our perception on a massive scale. Facebook changes a sentence on their homepage and a billion people read it. Youtube raises some parameter yeah I know that s not how AI works by 0.01 and the political opinion about the Grenfell tower disaster changes ever so slightly - for 30 million people. Google s filter has a tiny hole and some troll broadcasts wrong medical information about gout to 200k people.Every time one of these things happen, the world shakes. Dozens die or survive. Demonstrations form and elections swing. Opportunities are wasted and ideas surface.I am not arrogant to actually propose an easy solution to this, and I don t think there is one. Just be aware that I can always go and stab someone is not a good argument when you are discussing a fully automated drone swarm with kill authority.

2023-09-14 09:35:12.000	Everything causes the hourglass cursor to pop up - even just clicking on a button in OutlookAs someone who had to use a very slow 10-year-old iMac recently, I would prefer if macOS showed more indicators that it was busy. The macOS UI seems to assume things are near-instant that in that environment weren t even close.For example it reopened XCode after a reboot, and after a while it seemed the system was done doing background stuff. I clicked the System Settings and another app because I was going to need them, then tried to interact with XCode. Then the window turned gray and a spinner showed up that took a few minutes to disappear. It wasn t done at all. It turns out showing a screenshot to seem more responsive only works if you can very quickly back up the lie when necessary.
2013-10-02 14:24:33.000	MySQL is pretty good in practice, I think many complaints are indeed just user error. That said - Much like MongoDB, the defaults sacrifice safety for performance, e.g. MyISAM tables which everyone everywhere will tell you never to use, but are IIRC still the default ignore things like foreign key constraints- Lots of error conditions silently complete as best as they can, rather than failing with an error. E.g. trying to store the wrong type of value, or trying to make a table using a disabled storage engine, or trying to store a string in an encoding that can t represent all its characters. A lot of this is legacy that is slowly being improved on, but reputation naturally lags slightly behind- The query planner is a bit simplistic, so if you want performance you do need to put a little more thought into tables so that you re not doing 5-way joins all the time- Some more advanced features of other databases like triggers just don t exist. IMO they are bad features and shouldn t be used, but their absence provides an easy thing to criticize mysql for if you re that way inclinedIt s perfectly possible to make a good product using MySQL, quite possibly better than you would with other databases. But you do need to be very scrupulous about checking for warnings after every statement.

Or worse, spending tens of millions on something like a data warehouse or ERP system and then limiting compensation for the individuals tasked with extracting value from those systems to 90-120,000. But now we re way off topic...

People generally agree it s the best resource for its purpose and there was an article in one of the bigger local newspaper about it too. There are no ads or other shadiness on the site. It used to rank between 3 to 5 for the couple of obvious search terms, but since a site overhaul the ranking has tanked. I contacted Google via GWT but no response though in the past they ve been helpful a few times .

It s about reducing CO2 emissions right now, no proxy allowed, no IFTTT schemes.There might be a bare minimum amount of CO2 allowed, it s fixed. We could monetize that but it doesn t matter. We can t go beyond that amount.

2013-08-08 14:30:23.000	I ve never heard of it, but I wouldn t be surprised if we did.But It s not clear to me that the rule is at all relevant to that scam. As you describe it, it s not that the victims reasonably appeared to be agreeing to do one thing when what they signed said something different. They were persuaded to buy a blanket for x thousand dollars, and did.The most obvious tool contract law has to undermine that is misrepresentation. If the scammer told a lie to get the victim to sign, then the contract s voidable by the victim. This is true even if the misrep is innocent. If it s fraudulent, then you get a better measure of damages - and, of course, the scammers might ve committed the criminal offence of fraud .There s also a doctrine of undue influence , which if proved can also make the contract voidable.Finally, even if the contract is valid, since R v Hinks 2000 UKHL 53, it s not impossible that the scammers could be convicted of theft of the money. So, validly transferred per civil law, theft per criminal law! Which is... surprising. IMHO it s bloody stupid, but that s another debate .

Then the generated wrappers and static type checking in various languages add additional guarantees that you re using the data correctly.Plain XML still requires a lot to ensure compatibility when it s used across multiple places, protobufs attempt to minimize many sources of the incompatibilities.Add in a bunch of tools such as protobuf- JSON, protobuf plaintext serialization, etc and it becomes more difficult to argue for using something such as XML or vanilla JSON.Flatbuffers are still a nice solution for more performance-critical applications.
2011-07-31 23:28:33.000	1100 is cheap for a nice room or studio with your own bath, but there certainly are many options cheaper than 1100. I ve stayed with friends spending 400-600 in SF in the Mission, Downtown and Tenderloin areas, and these aren t people that have been living there for years under rent control. A search on Craigslist shows a lot of options in SF for under 800.Hacker Houses of course have the added benefit that they are also a productive place to work and thus don t require you to pay for an open desk in a co-working space.Artist houses are a much better example of how low you can go insofar as living costs are concerned. I wish there were more hackers that were interested in the approach artists take.

He presents several solutions, not all of which I would buy.The is_deleted column is a pretty simple solution that we all use and there are a number of solutions to the problem of retrieving only the active columns, such as views.Audit trails and performance are more interesting. A while back I worked for a web analytics company and we had the problem of the storage and performance costs of historical data. Only the 5 of the data was of any real interest, but the 95 historical data made writes slow because of the large number of indexes. They adopted the solution of historical tables with fewer indexes on cheaper drives.I like the solution of serializing historical, deleted, and audit data and storing them in a NonSQL database of your choice. Then you can bring them back as individual undos, or into a data mining database for scenario playing.I dont particularly like his suggestion of creating separate tables for each state of an element. I think that s needless complexity.

The world is interconnected, and countries do things to give themselves an advantage.Back the ye olden times, the methods for this kind of stuff were often less subtle. Countries would visit your nation with big battleships. Or they would slap big tariffs on imports, etc. The British and Russian Empires engaged in the Great Game throughout the 19th century for dominance of central asia.

It s bizarre and selfish how consumer technology alerts you immediately about friend requests but not local emergencies. It s bizarre and selfish how your phone can show people your apps, contacts, and calendar, but not emergency medical information. Having apps x, y, and z can someone solve these for an individual, but as a society we haven t progressed much with this technology. The idea that the person beside me might have a heart attack, and I d have to navigate their phone to find an ICE contact just baffles the hell out of me.

2021-06-07 01:26:23.000	When I lived in Denmark, I did indeed eat out at restaurants less, but probably ate socially about the same amount. It s legal to drink alcohol in public, so on nice days, we d either get takeout, or a single-use grill and some burgers and beers, and picnic in a park or on the waterfront. On particularly nice days you can see tens of thousands of people doing this in Copenhagen. On less nice days, just go to someone s apartment.Now I m back in the US, where it seems going to a restaurant is the default way of eating socially, even for just informal meetings with friends. Partly because it s cheap I d guess, and partly there is less public space and more legal restrictions on what you can do in it. Overall I don t really like that aspect of the culture. Seems unnecessary to me to have the whole formality of a waiter who takes orders and serves you plates and whatever just for a random weekday meal with friends. But I m presumably not representative.

2017-01-13 19:04:45.000	I m starting to see quite a few brands co-opting the President-elect s signature slogan like they have here. This baffles me. On the one hand, yes, it s a slogan that pretty much every at least American knows and is familiar with. On the other hand, there s some very significant portion of the population that is very viscerally offended at the least by the President-elect. So to jump on that wagon, you risk very strongly offending and alienating a large portion of the population along a line that has nothing to do with whether or not they d be you consumer...but with which way their political beliefs fall.My comment isn t meant to be a judgement call on whether or not doing this is normalizing something distasteful...it s simply meant to point out that OWC like many other brands may be shooting themselves in the foot over a lazy and reactionary marketing gimmick.
2013-09-02 18:51:30.000	This is dumb.- I don t want to mix work and personal stuff on the same machine. Too much could go wrong in terms of liability network security, personal vs corporate IP . And if I don t use my personal machine, then I m shelling out another 1000- 2000 to get another laptop and software for work possibly more for a desktop, depending on the use case .- If your company is so blinkered that it can t be bothered to provide its employees with the bare minimum equipment and tools they need to be productive, then they can go eff themselves. A developer costs a company hundreds of thousands of dollars a year in salary and benefits, and even a good workstation setup is probably much less than 5000 every couple of years.

Despite the potential of state-of-the-art models, harnessing their power is not simple.In an ideal world, developers would be able to easily utilize the power of advanced models without sacrificing efficiency or safety. There should be no limitations on creativity and innovation.The challenge lies in creating a framework that is not just another tool, but a revolution. Optimal optimization at the foundational level, prioritizing user experience, and introducing a future-proof design philosophy is a monumental task that nobody has been able to achieve.The opportunity to bridge this gap is enormous and offers not just recognition but also the power to redefine an entire industry. The key to unlocking this future lies in insight, and the rewards for accomplishing this feat will be significant.Introducing Zeta Zeta is our revolutionary solution. The secret lies in our philosophy of fluidity, which values modularity, reliability, usability, and unmatched speed. By committing to evolution, pushing boundaries, and never settling, Zeta will revolutionize the world of AI.We have been there from the start, experiencing the challenges and frustrations faced by developers. With our deep understanding of the industry, we are poised to lead the revolution. We have done it before, and with Zeta, we are doing it again. Zeta isn t just the next step, it s a leap into the future. Zeta is the future of AI.

One pic has one of the women showing a little tiny, tiny midriff but the image cropping really minimizes the amount of skin shown. They are dressed in a fun take on the black tie affair kind of way... not half nekkid. So your comparison on the men with shirts undone to their waist is quite a bit extreme.sharing a kissSecond, call it a crazy double standard or what have you but the fact is, many girl friends do stuff like this while not many guys do. When my wife is hanging out with her girl friends it is not uncommon for one of them to lick another at some point in the evening. I can honestly say that I don t recall ever being involved in a licking with another guy. I also don t accompany my guy friends to the restroom but that seems to be popular with the women. Men and women are different after all.

In another, all kids are 100 kept out of sunlight until they re three or four. Both are real world examples. .

2022-04-26 06:03:08.000	There s a relevant term called DDD Trilemma I like it because it s easy to find back articles on it . It states that you can t have both a pure, complete and performant domain.For example, I think what you describe is opting to inject a service to the domain that makes it indirectly talk to the database. In light of the trilemma , we can imagine it sacrifices a little bit of purity external dependency, stronger tie to the database schema in order to keep things simpler -- and nothing wrong with that. In some cases performance could be affected too ie. if the natural logic might want to update an entity twice during the course of a transaction .But you still have completeness in that you can query your domain as one unit and handle logic within it.I like that the DDD Trilemma acknowledges there is no universal, perfect solution for handling the object-relational mapping problem.

2010-04-01 17:53:34.000	I think the one of the most telling nuggets in that piece is from designer Jonathan Ive For us, it is all about refining and refining until it seems like there s nothing between the user and the content they are interacting with Also, as someone with experience in quantitative marketing, the following quote made a lot of sense as well. In my opinion, quantitative marketing and analytics are great tools, and as we ve seen in both sports and business, people use them do have an advantage. Again, however, in my opinion these tools are too reactionary and don t leave as much room for creative thought. It s not for us to predict what others will do, Ive says. We have to concentrate on what we think is right and offer it up. You gotta give it to jobs, that Ive guy is obviously incredibly bright and Jobs takes credit for finding him too.

2019-10-02 06:31:18.000	Surely they knew about buffer overflows, that is something that Burroughs B5500 nowadays known as Unisys ClearPath were already trying to tackle in 1961 with ESPOL NEWP, and C.A.R Hoare has a couple of Algol-60 papers talking about safety and use of bounds checking as one of the preventive measures.Sure bound exploits aren t limited to C, however there is a big difference between having them in easily locatable unsafe blocks, or areas where one has to explicitly disable them, and having every line of code being a possible source of exploits due to either memory corruption or UB.According to Google s security team 68 of security exploits in Linux kernel are caused by buffer overflows. Check their talk at Linux Kernel Summit 2018.At Linux Kernel Summit 2019, they have a couple of newer statistics and are adding hardware memory tagging to Android, based on their collaboration with ARM. And Android s native code including NDK are probably the most locked down after OpenBSD, in terms of security frameworks that can t be turned off.SPARC Solaris, is the only other UNIX that can actually tame C security issues, and even ADI doesn t cover 100 of all possible cases.

Anyone who can t have an uncertain job, who doesn t have lots of extra time, is currently employed compared to a college student getting their first job , and can t have periods without insurance for trial periods .Even if that s a feature you re looking to force into your recruiting program, you re probably better off getting a trust fund baby work force by targeting overseas volunteer work.
2022-10-27 18:38:47.000	I suspect that Apple has been in progress of moving things over to USB-C for a while see the recent Apple TV and iPad changes . They have already moved off of USB-A chargers completely, moving onto USB-C chargers.My understanding is they are also pushing the upper limits of what lightning charging cables are rated for, my suspicion is that it can t support PPS, so the lightning port is now limiting them both in charging speed flexibility and in data transfer.But in some markets like the US you have more lightning-charged iPhones than android phones. It is a lot big cost for their customers to bear, throwing away a decade of chargers and cables when Apple is not really going to be able to express it as an improvement to them - for instance, most phone users don t use the data channel at all, getting updates and backing up data with the cloud.I find it odd people think their reluctance has been to defend profits on some sort of lightning cable ecosystem. Their margin on phones is likely 100 . Their margin on the licensing for a third-party cable is likely below 0.50.I d argue this regulation is great for Apple, because it gives them a scapegoat. Apple then claims didn t necessarily _want_ to cost their customers a bunch of money, but the EU mandated it. So Apple is going to go ahead and make the change worldwide.But hey, look, at the same time we improved phone charging speeds and look how fast we can transfer ProRes media you captured with your phone now to your computer? Feel free to tack those new official charging cables and data transfer cables along with any chargers you need at purchase, if you don t have any already.

2014-03-28 11:38:02.000	AFAIK Every AAA game pays a flat rate per game in the 100k-500k range , not the rev share. The rev share agreement would only be for indie non-pros.Based on industry knowledge, the AAA flat rate game licencing costs don t seem to be going down.One reason might be that once you have a few Unreal engine Cryengine games under your belt, the cost to switch engines is HUGE. You re basically locked in unless you want to re-hire re-train the majority of your programmers.

We are excited to see all of the innovative use cases of ExecuTorch built by the community. extensive documentation should be a link to said extensive documentation A seemingly nitpicky comment, but I think it s a simple yet important way of encouraging customer onboarding.

Person doesn t feel good, so the doctor orders a useless test, test comes back negative so the person feels better. Then we complain health care cost too much.10 full blood panel samples a year with other bio-metric data and a data set of 20 million people to do classification on would crush the doctor over time.This bullshit health system though makes it impossible to have any real innovation at a mass scale. We will never have personal higher frequency medical data in my lifetime that would actually hugely improve the system and cut most of the cost out.

For those that actually need it, it works wonders.But there is a serious percentage of college-aged ADHD diagnoses that are about as legitimate as most medical marijuana prescriptions. These kids are just snorting Adderall so they can cram for an exam or pull an all-nighter and finish a term paper.

After about 30 minutes, the conductor announces that they have tried plugging some of the holes in an air tank brakes, presumably with wood, but it hasn t worked !!! so we ll have to wait for the following train and change on to it - we have broken down on a section of double track so the next train pulls alongside. Made it to Washington on a really packed train. We are due to have the dining car hitched up to us here, but it has an electrical fault so nope - no cooked food for the journey! Delays while faulty car unhitched. Drunk woman staggers through train shouting Goddamn it, has anyone got a Budweiser and a Cigarette! Still in Washington Drunk woman and a man she met are hauled off the train by police for getting a bit too..er.. romantic in a corridor! Outskirts of Atlanta - running slow for some reason - we hit a man walking to work down the track. Train stops and we can see police, fire and ambulance out the window. Man is hauled off to hospital by police and paramedics with nothing more than badly cut arm. Conductor announces that the man didn t hear us coming and has apologized for the delay he has caused. Made it to Atlanta station - receive phone call from the people picking us up...they have never used the train and don t know where the station is. We give directions.

If you openly talked about your weird hobby, you d be as likely as not socially ostracized and made fun of.Today, thanks to the internet and social media, one can find forums and discussion groups for any hobby, no matter how weird or esoteric, and have fun conversations with people that have nothing to do with weather, politics, or sportsball.

2021-07-02 11:27:20.000	This is a common statement and I don t think this is true.Foremost If someone had cancer, that does not mean he would have died immediately. Heck, he could have survived it, or at least lived for several more years.Second This does not explain the huge numbers of deaths. You can easily compare how many people died of with lung cancer from 2019 to 2020 and then for 2020 to 2021 and clearly see that COVID made a difference here called Übersterblichkeit in German, and visible in all COVID-affected countries .And AFAIK most countries do actually not report a death with COVID, e.g. a car accident, as being caused by COVID.In other words, this is a common myth from the skeptics department and only serves in undermining COVID-related efforts, even if well intended.

We live in an era where people ought to understand the difference between power measured in watts and energy measured in joules, or calories, or watt-hours .But for some reason this is widely misunderstood, resulting in frequent errors and poor decision making. The Times, a generally-reputable UK newspaper, once published a front page headline declaring that electric vehicles would require the equivalent of 20 new nuclear plants to be built in the UK. None of their fact checkers noticed that the entire article was based on an error that confused GWh energy with GW power .

A company must invest a certain amount of money into labor to make a profit however, if that company learns it can invest less money into endeavours to make the same profit, then it can decrease the amount invested into labor. The only way to do so is to create some sort of technology, or social relation, that makes the price of individual workers cheaper. Thus, any reduction of cost of labor that increases profit is something that makes employees more replaceable.

If you only have manual control, then perhaps a driveshaft must be made larger and heavier for the case of the ham-fisted user. If the transmission is under software control, the software can be careful about accelerations to avoid overstressing the driveshaft.The point is that when you consider the system as mechanical, electrical and software you get a lot more flexibility than if you think of it as mechanical and electrical but we do some stuff in software.

It s deeply immoral to hoard money and resources to be rich in today s language and ensure the system of resource hoarding continues over generations through lobbying and corruption. That s the extent of the comparison -- the magnitude of the immorality -- and I think it s fair?

Mostly because businesses aren t really interested in the risks involved.Nobody cares about fixing this though. They just think throwing money at poor nations will somehow bring people above the poverty line.Many countries in Africa are a good example of this not working.We also perpetuate the issue through massive donations because local industries can t compete with free and the citizens become endlessly dependent.

I think this paper is still the best in terms of being done by NLP experts and understanding the possibilities and not being just some and mirror. But there are so many papers published in this area nowadays that I might not even notice a new one. The CUAD paper was still based on BERT, so pretraining was needed - that needs a bit more expertise than just prompting GPT-4-32k like in this paper or feeding prompts back to GPT-4 for another round of refining, or doing RAG. For honest research purposes, contract review is not really a good area of approach the subject field is not standardised, there is no good benchmark yet and your paper can easily get into bad company of snake oil sellers cashing on visceral hatred of average people for all professions.

Here s a decent collection of charts has been shocking to me to see how cheap and effective healthcare can be in other countries, from an emergency visit to the hospital in the US I got a 50k bill for one emergency surgery to an eye test and new pair of glasses US costs running 500- 1000, although startups have chipped away at this . In the US, healthcare is effectively a collection of cartels -- an enormous parasite that will be nearly impossible to rip off our soft underbelly.

2016-05-31 08:27:29.000	I agree to an extent and in my current project have been making heavy use of PL SQL to handle a lot of data logic having come off a project that tried to use Entity Framework to achieve the same thing.PL SQL, for all its problems, does make it pretty straightforward to write a data API - AddX, AddYToX, AssociateXAndZ. It provides a nice abstraction over whatever table structure you may have and also makes it very clear, especially in the case of Table per Hierarchy type structures, what fields are required in what cases.The key thing is to limit yourself to what the language is good at - reading and writing data. You shouldn t need to do things like string manipulation, date conversions etc - that is what the calling code is responsible for doing. For me it makes sense to associate the data with the logic specifically relating to it as frontends can come and go without the underlying structure changing.
2023-12-17 20:07:10.000	Unfortunately, no me neither. I think this issue extends beyond cats, it s the uncontrolled breeding of animals, which imo leads to all sorts of abuse.I find it amazing that anyone can decide I m going to buy a breeding pair of cats with the end goal of making money.We need to phase out cats and dogs completely. This saddens me deeply because I love my dog but the damage these animals do to the environment is so large I don t think I can truly fathom.We can do this slowly, first pets needs to be desexed. For cats there s no exception. For dogs the exception would be breeding working dogs, or therapy guide dogs. With cats they must be kept in doors at all times. These laws should extend to larger animals like horses.In Australia we have a huge problem with horses and camels. But the public do not support culls of horses, even if it s for their own benefit eg to stop them from starving in winter . But the horse racing industry is huge here, they ve got clout and political pressure.Uncontrolled breeding of animals for human enjoyment is amoral. Animal companionship is of course the exception but this comes with issues.
2022-04-12 17:26:48.000	Fair point, it s categorically true that no critic watches every single movie released and I definitely overstated that. A brief search on Statista indicates that about 700 movies are released a year, the average American sees 2.3 movies a year in theaters , and professional critics review over 200 movies a year, some even review 300.I maintain that given this disparity 2.3 movies a year versus 200 a year my point still stands, critics will tend to watch movies regardless of any predisposition towards them whereas an audience member will be much more discriminating about which 2.3 movies they will pay to see.

Perhaps I have blinders on, but I don t ever recall any casual racism or homophobia. If anything I d say it s a more progressive city than many other small conservative midwestern towns. There is considerable diversity in the city, given that many of the engineers who live here have come from other countries. There was a recent presentation about the problems of conversion therapy , and the presbyterian church a few weeks ago had a day of remembrance specifically for those who are transgender.Not saying it s anything along the lines of Colorado, or the bay area, which I ve frequented the past decade - but I think 2017 Columbus IN is vastly different than late 90s Columbus IN. The article really nails it.

2014-10-13 17:56:45.000	Thank you for the viewpoint.MBAs, as used to segregate people in a bureaucracy, are a good idea. Your company has a pretty good idea that you have heard of accounting and it s theory, marketing as a profession, and the business and it s place in law and society having done an MBA. Yes, to many people, this is common sense but with thousands of people working for you common is very hard to come by. MBA degrees fill a function, to get everyone the same vocab, ideas, and implementations of those things. It leads to group think by design, it has to. You simply cannot have 500 people working together with different definitions or fuzzy ideas of what accounting actually does. It would be chaos.MBAs are a symptom of bureaucracy, not a cause of it. Group Think as well, you have to have standard definitions, processes, and procedures. The issue is when you loose sight of that need and create orthodoxy.
2018-09-23 08:21:53.000	It s not necessarily about shock value, it can be just about realism. In real life, people smoke, have sex, pick their nose, throw up, swear etc. LOTR can work without this as it s an epic fairy tale that doesn t need deep and developed characters.But if you want to make something like Breaking bad, you re seriously artistically limited by arbitrary ratings.

2008-03-05 12:29:27.000	1, You re not screwing anything up. You re creating some new product from scratch, and resources spent learning a new tool will be resources saved in future projects that use the same tool.2, And old releases have bugs that will hardly be fixed because the support has been dropped. Follow the six month rule, and then, if you find more bugs, report. It is a lot more likely that the bugs in a new version will be fixed, and quickly, than in an old version.3, The amount of resources the change will save due to its improvements. I am not saying it will always net positive, but it will also not net negativly always, so it is worth a study. Dismissing because We don t know is not a valid excuse, or should not be.4, Once more, use the six months rule. Anything that is still a hype after six months in a fast paced market like IT is worth a look only for this merit.5, Again, it depends on how much time the change will save BOTH in the current project and in future ones. A mistake always made is to consider only the current project as time spent. This is unfair and will lead to biased results that will cause the change to be refused nearly always.6, You talk like my manager. Are you him?I know you are not making any judgement. You are telling me what you have heard before, probably when faced with the same situation. Problem is, when faced with counter arguments the final answer is We don t know or We don t want to . It is a lose lose situation.

It s a bit of a middle ground, perhaps? Yeah, I think our position is often misunderstood as put everything in the database layer. That is definitely not how I think. I just think moving stuff to the database layer is one possible tool in the toolshed.One thing I like to use it for is when it s a low level database concern, like generating an audit trail whenever a particular table is changed. To me, populating that audit trail is clearly a database concern and not an application concern. And if there are heavy writes to that table, the performance difference may be large

However, I should point out that concrete structures fail regularly and frequently, and sadly with great loss of human life, most recently in Miami. I should also point out that I ve seen this argument used as a tactical trick. I watched a Microsoft rep using this argument successfully convince a management team that they should use Embedded Windows instead of Linux because, just as you pointed out, we know how it fails , we know how to detect failures , we know how to remediate problems .

2020-07-27 09:15:06.000	Because many also enjoy the experience of being admired or envied by others, perhaps even more than the original experience itself... I have many acquaintances who go to great lengths and expenses for an experience they don t particularly enjoy but which pays off on social mediaThat s my whole point. No wonder people are unhappy when they rely on external things for happiness and fulfillment. It s peak stupidity.I don t believe what you re describing is sustainable long term.I think Jim Carrey said it best I think everybody should get rich and famous and do everything they ever dreamed of so they can see that it s not the answer.
2017-02-28 13:34:14.000	This proposal makes no sense. It wouldn t improve security, it just proposes an annoying UI that in itself is a security risk, and the stripping away of several useful features of the current trust system.Critically, unbinding public private keys from DNS names removes a layer of trust. I trust my browser-maker to grant only legitimate CAs approval to sign certificates that will be accepted by default by my browser, and my DNS provider to send me the correct IP for a given name, and I trust myself that I know the DNS name of the site I want to visit. Those three things work in concert with each other to give me a relatively high level of assurance that I m talking to the site I mean to be. What s more, thanks to certificates, I can verify this all myself! Export the site certificate, and check its signing chain to go back to the CA, which I can also decide for myself if I want to trust or not, if I don t trust the browser-maker s judgment.Add to that certificate revocation, and I fail to see how the proposed plan makes any sense at all. The author never makes a case that name-based certificates are actually a problem. Browser makers are free to add extra layers of security to the current system that could do what the author proposes. But from little details of what he says I suspect what s really going on is that he just doesn t want to pay for certificates or deal with setting up Lets Encrypt.

Unfortunately, after reading the paper, I have to say that their approach is fairly basic. Basically they threshold the precipitation in 4 thresholds no rain, light, medium, heavy and then use a U-Net like architecture, treating it as a classification problem. I think that the works of Shi et al are much more interesting in this regard I think is that Google wanted to use a lighter model that can be applied to the whole continental US. I expect them to integrate this in google assistant, like hey google, tell me when it s going to rain
2018-01-03 13:44:54.000	It s not timing the segfault delivery itself, the idea is to time another read of your own address space after the fault to see if it s been prefetched or not.Maybe you could CLFLUSH on segfault delivery though.

The problem is reCaptcha, just stop using reCaptcha as Google is tracking all of us.My personal opinion is that it s better to use hCaptcha. I wasn t aware that they don t support audio. I think a better approach would be requesting hCaptcha to implement the missing bit.Giving less control to Google is better. Given the widespread tracking they have access to right now.

Look up on esbuild swc.Last I heard JetBrains is also looking into adopting LSP so maybe we could even pay for JetBrains LSP to use with VSCode some day
2015-06-26 15:59:31.000	I expect this will be inevitable, but since the density of self-driving cars is so low, developing such a protocol is premature.Also, the over all design should exist in such a way that it doesn t rely on such car to car communication. For example, if a person is standing in the road, or a deer jumps into the lane, the car should be able to react accordingly.Having a car-to-car protocol would be helpful for the average case, but since there are so many tricky edge cases, I suspect full autonomy being developed to its maximum potential may make it unnecessary.
2020-09-05 20:19:51.000	Followers on GitHub is nothing but a popularity contest. I know, because until recently I had like a dozen followers, mostly people I knew, some prolific followers, and a handful of people who actually probably did so because they enjoyed my work. Then I wrote a couple of blog posts about Homebrew and companies choosing their tech stacks and suddenly I had a hundred new people following me-not because they thought my code was any good, but presumably because they enjoyed my writing, which had essentially nothing to do with the kinds of things I put on GitHub. I hope they re not disappointed, to be honest. If you look at highly-followed accounts, they are always people who write giant awesome lists, or maybe have a substantial Twitter presence, or are the primary maintainer of one popular project. There s a huge number of highly-skilled people who have essentially no followers at all.
2012-03-21 21:33:56.000	My non-programmer friends and family are always bewildered when I tell them that I hope my daughter doesn t grow up to be a programmer. The reason why is because I m afraid her life would be like the OP s. There is indeed a subtle sexism in our industry. That s why things like yesterday s Sqoot screwup happen so frequently.Of course, every workplace is different and I m sure there are plenty of places where women don t have to deal with the bullshit described in this article. However, they are far from the norm. I can see why the OP would want to leave the industry rather than be the person constantly reporting people to HR and lecturing them about proper behavior. It may be the right thing to do, but it s also extremely uncomfortable and just as likely to create an even more hostile working environment than before.

2009-08-15 16:15:11.000	I ve done quite a bit of conflict resolution in my day. I once worked as a resident assistant RA in the dorm and had to deal with very similar problems.Here is my textbook answer. You want to meet with the person on their terms. Go to his her office room on a day when the issue is not prevalent, because neither of you want emotion to be an igniting factor. Be humble. Yes, you re pissed and it s clearly them, but trust me, the best action is to bite the bullet and see if the two of you can come to some sort of agreement.Strike a deal. Clearly the other person has some motivating reason behind their issue. If you can fix their problem in a way that they can t, it might also alleviate your problem. In your specific case, I would talk to everyone else in the complex for him. See if you can get action items written down. I affirm that I will keep the outside door closed at all times . Make sure these action items are clear and understood by everyone. Yes, you may have to talk to everyone personally.

2016-10-29 10:52:46.000	It s not ideal, but eBPF works now, and it works on all the new kernels, which is more than can be said for any of the DTrace on Linux projects. It looks like eBPF is becoming that unified solution mostly ftrace and a few others still exist, but eBPF is the most capable, and is picking up steam . As for being different from what the other Unixes did, that s why I was in favor of developing a frontend that supported D, so that we could at least have a shared language with the rest of unixland. My question to Brendan was why he couldn t just take or enhance the existing DTrace codebase to do the front-end for BPF?Brendan didn t answer, so I don t know, but my guess was that turning the interpreter into a compiler would require a near-complete rewrite.

I am not smart enough to be able to articulate them but they are there.
2021-12-20 23:33:35.000	Maybe you re right. My overarching point to OP who was doubting what managers-of-managers do, is that this a big part of the job, and it takes time, and effort.There is also a big difference between doing these things as the CEO of a 100-person startup, where every choice you make is a reflection of you, a reflection of the culture you re setting up, and contribute to the legacy that YOUR company will have, vs as the Sr. Manger of a 100-person org in a huge company, where ultimately it s not your company.
2013-03-01 04:33:38.000	I did this. It was scary because I was leaving a very well-paying job, but I was so excited for all the possibilities. In a year, I produced tons of awesome code, that did what it was written to do. But the product itself floundered, and never took a shape that I could believe in. I even tried hiring others to give it a fresh take, but that didn t work.In the meantime, it sped the end of a relationship. She seemed as obsessed with her own goals of starting a family as I was with my goals of starting a company. There was little middle ground. My bank account ran dry sooner than expected. I didn t find quite enough freelance work to stay afloat.Finally, faced with a rapidly shrinking runway, the prospect of 1.5 years intense coding work amounting to nothing but uninspiring demos, and nobody else but me invested, I imploded. Meltdown. I was grasping at every straw, but it was all just that. Straw. The SO was gone. The money was gone. I d taken the initiative to start interviewing, but nothing was connecting up.This led to one of the darkest depressions of my life. Things are only just starting to look up now, as I ve finally had a job offer with a company that I m truly excited to work at. And the work that I did while independent played a big part in landing the job. I can t say whether it was worth it - only that this is how it happened, and I m very grateful that it did. I feel it did not have to be so miserably hard.So, I suggest having even more cushion than you think you need. Keeping your relationships with colleagues warm. Pursuing other plans, contracts, or job prospects while you work on your idea. If you do not already have very supportive family and friends around who believe in what you re doing, ask yourself if you have the personality to really believe in yourself that much. Anything so it does not have to be like I must succeed at this or life is over.
2013-08-22 19:25:32.000	We don t have to have direct knowledge of the impossibly specific situation you ve constructed.Instead we have people saying I am white and I set one off in 2003 in Australia and they let me through, therefore that demonstrates that this is racism ignore every case where non-whites got a couple of quick questions and went through .And how utterly provincial are so many people on here? What backwaters do they live in? Go to JFK or Newark and tell me that they pick on non-whites, and I ll tell you that they must have hundreds of thousands of employees working around the clock to manage that.Further what an FBI agent purportedly said during the conversational stage is utterly irrelevant. We don t know what explosive material the sensor detected, but by the response it seems likely that it was rare.Finally, this isn t just about racismIndeed, it isn t, even though the overwhelming majority of comments, and the title itself, portends racism. In another comment someone criticizes me for apparently claiming that their treatment is reasonable. Yet never did I say their treatment was reasonable. Who would?they wouldn t even tell him what they had foundBecause they believe in the flawed concept of security through obscurity. They likely imagine that giving that information away shows their hand.

2016-10-18 03:48:58.000	Am I being uncharitable in saying the TLDR is This is working as expected and you need to do more work to make AMP work for you?Why can t it work with templates, why does content that was created need to be created again for AMP? This doesn t seem very scalable.Also, the attribution for ads and analytics basically means you need to reimplement your entire tracking code within the schema and spec of AMP s analytics attributes which only supports a subset of existing providers rather than allowing an abstract interface.Also to the point that AMP doesn t affect search position, is this true if someone serves a shitty AMP page? Or is it only true that it won t boost position?
2022-08-22 07:12:34.000	The whole point is that God loves his people enough to save them, the Church will expand, and Christ will return in glory.ish.

2016-10-08 20:16:18.000	I m always happy to see Prolog get some love. Learning it in a university course really expanded my mind, similar to when I first tried FP with ML in another course.I went to a talk about MicroKanran, another logic programming language, which is embeddable in host languages. I think it shows a lot of promise for implementing decision engines. The biggest downside is that it can be tough to reason about the runtime characteristics of nontrivial programs, right about at the point where the paradigm starts to be really useful for modeling complex problems. It takes some experience to know how to write it efficiently.

2021-02-16 20:22:30.000	Thanks for the response, but IMO both of those solutions are strictly worse than having a build step that takes care of it.Also, there are tools that only bundle npm deps, like Snowpack or Vite. I think those would be perfect for your use case.
2022-10-11 20:00:00.000	IMO if the business model is to pay for impressions, I wish they d be up front and just state and charge price per mille or hundred or whatever . Instead you get an ambiguous boost with no accountability metrics about what even happened? They could literally show you to no one and say Oops, guess your profile sucks! The match rate thing is also kind of a lark because you don t care about matches. You care about matches with people you want to match with... in fact that kinda understates the ultimate goal -- you care about matches with someone who would be good for you and you for them ... everything else is just vanity.

2015-10-09 02:20:50.000	A decent CS undergrad degree decade ago included abstract math concepts. I took Engineering math, Information Theory, Numerical analysis, Probability, Simulation in my sophomore and Junior years. NLP and AI were electives in Senior year.As a Junior, we were building toy programs that do Operations research type of work - solving linear equations via various matrix operations, design optimal queue processes based on poisson process.Assuming a software engineer is a CS undergrad, he she most likely has good footing to learn more by themselves.

I think the data captured by CA was also entered for the purposes of sharing, often limited to friends and friends of friends. I think the crux of this all is that as a society we haven t really established how those rights are transferred. If I share my email address with a friend, can they share it with their contact management app? I m not sure how you create a consistent policy in a federated model.

But because the goverment would use it to balance its accounts insted of invest in the public helth system it was extinct in 2007.CMPF funding could only be used by healthcare, pensions and social welfare.Universal healthcare systems are expensive.Brazil and any other country, really universal healthcare system needed and had a reasonably big budget that was paid basically by CPMF alone, so all the other combined taxes and contributions paid for everything else. The government, by law, could not move the funds to anything else.The reason it was extinct is because it was a direct tax over wealth translation of the establishment the banked class - around that time more that 60 of Brazil was unbanked and therefore not directly affected.Now that Brazil no longer has a contribution specifically destined to healthcare and pensions, both it s universal healthcare system and pension system are in a much worse state.

Especially when the cost is him more-or-less idle for the better part of the year but still paid as well as the cost for all of these administrators and lawyers fabricating nonsense for over a year. Further, the employee in this case had tenure protection the university abuses Title IX and other policies to railroad him out of his position.If there is an inconsistency, it s that the folks who love reducing everything to power dynamics are somehow not analyzing this as a clear-cut case of powerful university administrators abusing their considerable power over an employee. I mean, the provost made the unprecedented move of prosecuting a case that her underlings were adjudicating and flouted the requirement that she present her argument a week in advance. The author provided lots and lots of verifiable supporting evidence.

Staking pools are already heavily centralizing power in the network on centralized exchanges and decentralized contract pools like Lido which can be manipulated and changed with the keys of a small group of people.Vitalik is already preparing to organize social enforcement and democratic slashing for when these pools have their arms twisted to censor transactions by state actors. the merge has even happened, you have a central network leader preparing to use his influence to secure the network through what amounts to outside or meta-intervention we re forking the chain because we see something is wrong to prevent the technically possible attack in Buterin s own words in agreement with most reasonable blockchain folk from people already consolidating power for the post merge network.This is no longer a trustless and open system. Bitcoin does not scale, but it s proof of work distributed block ordering mechanism is not killing the planet or reliant on high demand energy - it is actually most profitable to mine Bitcoin with otherwise wasted, low demand energy. Even the premise for moving to PoS at least as a foil to Bitcoin is wrong.

When they speak of Russian money laundering in London, it s usually a complete fabrication.E Throttled, so can t reply directly to rwmj.Why would you risk bringing dirty money from Russia to the UK when Russia is so deeply corrupt that it ll be trivial to come up with extensive documentation demonstrating legitimate sources of funds?

They do need to work on building their market and they really screwed the pooch on the AI boat. The developer flywheel is hugely important and they missed out on that. That said, we can t expect them to go back in time, but we can keep moving forward. Having enough people making noise about wanting to play with their hardware is certainly a step in the right direction.

But all of that can suddenly change. As for ugly, I ve seen the ugliest people marry the most beautiful people. And some of these ugly people were total shy, introverts.So if you are ugly like me, and if you re down in your life like I ve been at times when my startup failed, be patient and continue on with life. It will get better. And for love of all that is holy, stay away from these sorts of nonsense absolutisms.
2008-10-15 01:48:01.000	At the last Y Combinator Demo Day I attended, there were 3 women in a room of over 100 people. That just seems a bit low to me, and I have no doubt that it reflects the candidate pool I m glad she mentioned this. How could Livingston not want more women founders? She s trapped with 80 dudes six months out of the year.I m certainly for equal treatment, but whether the media wants to admit it or not - people are different. That s why Title 9, quota hiring and Chief Diversity officers gag! have been such utter failures. Right idea, wrong execution. Working in admissions in school was one of the most eye opening things I ve ever done. Some of the other efforts are great, but most come off as discriminating double standards.

Mozilla gets shat on all the time, presumably because they re one of the few sources of hope and therefore disappointment in an overall increasingly problematic Internet landscape, and I wish they would be bigger too, but they re doing fine all things considered.Certainly I wouldn t say their problems are due to this particular apsect of their legal structure.
2021-10-08 15:42:18.000	I left my job with no future plans about a year ago. I was able to do this thanks to the company going through an IPO a few years prior and aggressive savings investing in my 20 s. I am 35 now.What worked well for me 1. Having a supportive partner. I am very lucky that my partner has not murdered me considering how much time we are at home together with her working all day from home and me not working. I know if roles were reversed, I would have a hard time.2. Having existing hobbies that require time and discipline. Most of my hobbies are pretty cheap running, reading, gaming, and cooking. The problem is, these all require time and discipline, which I used to not have. I treat my hobbies like a job and actually schedule time for each of these on a weekly basis. It s amazing how much time you can fill with stuff you love. It is also amazing how much more discipline you can have in your hobbies when you are not spending all of your discipline points on work. An exception for me is travel, which requires money, but not as much as you think if you fly on random weekdays and stay in hotels during off-peak times. Of course this has been limited during COVID.3. Having some part time technical work. For me, this was taking on some advising and mentoring roles. I get paid for some of them, but mostly I do it because I enjoy it and I feel it keeps me connected enough to the rest of the technical world.What did not work well 1. Doing this during COVID. I was completely naive in thinking that we would be going through this for a few more months last year. Not being able to see family and friends was made even harder because I cut off my social connections from my work colleagues I was lucky that I really liked most of my work colleagues . In hindsight, I wish I had thought through this more.2. Alcohol consumption and other vices. Since I did not have to be up every morning at 7am anymore, I was staying up late and drinking 5 nights a week. What got me to stop was my supportive partner identifying this for me and also seeing the liquor store bills add up. Thankfully, I was able to shake it, but it took about two months to change my habits.3. Obsessing over the stock market. Since my assets are 90 tied to equities, I was obsessing daily over the green and red lines. This is somewhat common in a lot of FI RE threads, but I realized that my very concentrated portfolio was stressing me out. I created a plan to slowly rebalance over the coming years, probably giving up some potential future gains, but the short term sanity gain is important to me.Unexpected benefits 1. Rarely waiting in lines. I can goto the bank or grocery store at 10 30am. I can goto a gym at 2pm. I still wonder why how a lot of places are open during these hours, but I get to benefit from it.2. Sleeping schedule fixed. While working, I was notorious for staying up late to get something done, sleeping 6-8 hours which is pretty good , and feeling exhausted when I woke up. On weekends, I would rarely get up before noon because I was so tired. After stopping work, my sleep schedule has moved to a pretty fixed 10pm-6 30am and I no longer am a night owl. Nothing wrong with being a night owl, but I thought I was one for a long time, and turns out, I am not.3. Exploring local area. With my limited vacation time, whenever we wanted to take time off, we would always hop on a plane and go somewhere. Having time and COVID restrictions had me exploring more locally running trails, businesses, cafes, libraries . I have a much deeper appreciation for what local governments do to make the places we live more enjoyable.Overall, I am very happy with the decision. I have no idea if I will end up going back to work or not. I realize that I am in the 0.0000001 of people that is lucky enough to be even thinking like this.

2018-03-16 05:50:21.000	The way around this is to give each person 1 ballot for each of N candidates. 1 ballot goes into an envelope and into the vote box. N-1 ballots go into envelopes and into the discard box. It s trivial to show a photo of your ballot for Dr. Evil, but it would take a video of you going into the voting booth, closely following your hands to prevent three-card-monty, and continuing to follow you into the public lobby containing the vote and discard boxes. If you strictly enforce no recording in the public lobby, then there s no way for you to prove to your boss which box got your ballot for Dr. Evil in the end.Edit Perhaps I wasn t clear. Each of the N ballots is already filled out for a different candidate. The envelopes are all identical and sealed by you inside the voting booth. That way an existence proof of a ballot for the given candidate leaks absolutely no information. There are no empty paper ballots, and none of the paper ballots can leave the polling station. Ballots need to be counted both from the vote and from the discard boxes. Ballots missing from the discard box prove vote tampering.
2017-02-08 21:57:39.000	If your regex has backreferences, or look-ahead look-behind assertions, or similar things, then your regex engine must support a backtracking strategy.There s a morphism that maps Phritzy s pattern to an equivalent pattern that can be matched with a Thompson NFA. It s a similar strategy to the one that allows you to take an NFA and turn it into a DFA. You can perform a sort of static decomposition on a subset of patterns containing backreferences, such that cat dog 1 for example decomposes into catcat dogdog . The caveat is that this isn t fully generalizable for all patterns containing backreferences.But saying that backreferences cannot be supported by a pattern matching engine that uses something other than backtracking is like saying that because there is no general algorithm no prove any given program P halts, then no program can be proven to halt. But that s trivially demonstrated to be untrue. RE2 chooses not to support any PCRE-style backreferences, because RE2 is a pattern matching engine meant to support patterns that are actually regular, and backreferences are not regular.

2020-04-23 20:34:44.000	Why are you downloading random crap from teh snap store to begin with?I m not, but the fact that there s the potential for junk to exist on the store in the first place is the problem, especially when there isn t adequate protection against typosquatting like I mentioned originally.As long as I only use the default repositories, I can apt install a package I ve never even heard of and it s pretty much guaranteed to not be malicious actively dangerous. With Snap, this guarantee doesn t exist to the same level.Sure, there is moderation and review in place, but this puts the Snap Store in the same realm as other stores and community maintained package managers, almost all of which have issues with junk dangerous packages. Snaps can t magically persist that is a load of FUD.Yes, in many cases this is right, but some of the most common Snap interfaces multiple of which can auto-connect would provide enough leverage on a system to gain persistence or actively interact with things outside of the sandbox.For example, the home interface is enough to compromise an average personal computer and probably gain persistence, as everything of value is usually within the home directory. I do like the fact that home disallows access to hidden files though. The x11 interface can even be auto-connected, and this potentially allows the Snap to read the graphical output of other applications.I agree that these scenarios are quite theoretical, but as foresto says in this thread, sandbox implies safe , and sandboxed Snaps are quite leaky compared to other sandboxes such as Firejail or a full-blown VM.Perhaps this is just a terminology problem? I would say that Snap sandboxing is far more comparable to permission management on an Android phone.

2018-04-27 21:12:19.000	Maybe people are saying that feelings don t matter, but a more interesting argument is that they re a sensation and it s misguided to assign them intrinsic moral import. In particular, it s unworkable to claim that if someone s feelings are hurt that another person has to modify their behavior, simply because feelings are entirely capricious.The analogy I ve often used is the feeling of being cold that you feel cold is simply a perception generated by nerve endings. It really is just in your head, but at the same time it s in your head for a reason. In the case of cold, not dying of exposure is a fairly dramatic reason, and you might lose your job if you ignored social feelings. So just as you would neither ignore nor get worked up over feeling cold and would just put on a jacket, often social feelings of offense and the like have some fairly practical solutions that are more obvious if you avoid moralizing them.So if kids were writing about feelings to recognize and solve problems, that would be helpful, but if it s just navel gazing, it s probably a waste of time.

If Twitter dies because it s impossible to sustain the valuation their investors were hoping for, perhaps someone would build a less ambitious alternative.Even though the magnitude is bigger, it could be similar to the Digg-Reddit saga. Digg was hyped as the next big thing, took too much money, made extremely risky moves and collapsed. and then collapsed. In the meantime, Reddit slowly built a less ambitious product that eventually replaced it.

I am not sure whether I am meeting a very different kind of Americans or it s ingrained in the culture there in US.Problem is they are usually not even willing to see that it s a different culture here, or that we tip based on the service and or the fact whether the restaurant charges a service charge or not it s additional to service tax .

2018-01-16 21:24:09.000	I feel like picking a fight. What s the downside? It s super simple to hash them, and it prevents a read-only exploit from turning into a major catastrophe.Example from something I built. If our db was used by an attacker, with all client API keys, they could go liquidate those accounts place phone calls . Huge loss, and not far-fetched this kind of attack happens daily and is profitable . With hashed API keys, nothing is possible. We don t even need to tell people to rotate keys. With plain keys, we d need to freeze usage for people without e.g. IP address restrictions in place.Read-only leaks happen all the time. Why not make sure they don t impact your clients API usage?I m not just trying to fight. It s a handful of trivially-validated lines of code that significantly mitigate the impact of a data leak. Seems like a super easy tradeoff.
2021-03-29 12:29:39.000	If companies are the lifeblood of the country, then the government is the bones. It provides absolutely necessary infrastructure like roads, water, sewers, and law enforcement. It provides economic and social stability through fiscal controls and food subsidies. It provides an educated population through schools.When viewed this way, the vitriol arising from a large company not paying taxes makes sense. The entire organism requires coordination in order to survive, and the government and companies need to work together and support each other in order to thrive.This isn t even going into the outrage arising from the fact that large companies are treated very differently from small businesses and individuals.
2012-09-15 20:12:49.000	If Apple has shown something, is what putting millions of dollars and more than a thousand full-time engineers working on a Unix OS with custom hardware looks like. Most Linux users don t care about the X server nor find it underperformant. Hell, not even GUI developers have to touch it.I would argue that Linux isn t mainstream because it has nothing like Apple s budget, specially on design and marketing. Add to that those hardware vendors that are actively hostile to support from other operating systems, and software developers that don t care, and you have it. Still, Linux is doing fine, for what resources it has.

2010-06-21 18:17:53.000	Heh, I stopped looking at this thread almost immediately after getting over the initial sting.But I have to say, I still feel that this kind of behavior would be a sane policy.No one s saying you should hold onto data forever. But having a dedicated pool of dead storage that s capable of storing the data for a few months of non-payment, or even longer -- that seems like a very good idea.The running VMs are so many, many times more expensive than a block of dead storage of equivalent size. Probably orders of magnitude more expensive.Then when you consider the business benefit to having the softer-and-fuzzier policy ... well, there s always the avoid high maintenance customers theory.
2021-01-08 17:25:07.000	See plant based milk, mayo, egg, meat, butter, etc. Also no one is ever upset about peanut butter which isn t butter!And it depends on your definition.

Their entire market is based around people knowing it is plant based. Yeti s homepage has in big bold text right at the top Real cheese, made from plants ... you could argue real cheese and made from plants is an oxymoron but my point is, no one buying the product is going to be confused.
2021-09-28 20:34:48.000	One key consideration that I only got recently is the difference between a cruise ballistic missile. A ballistic missile launches at great velocity, then more or less falls at it s target over an extended distance using a ballistic trajectory. A cruise missile is under power for a large part of it s journey, typically flying much lower, able to navigate direct itself.A ballistic missile is often quite supersonic. But cruise missiles being hypersonic is definitely a big shift.

Easy financing for personal autos may soon dissipate when the self driving car comes of age.Learning to drive may become a bespoke thing in 30 years. You only learn because your father mother family is an enthusiast that kept a sports car or classic maintained.The commercial pick up truck could hold out as the last non-autonomous vehicle. Maintenance and service will still be done by humans, for now.
2020-04-17 16:53:08.000	No it doesn t.I remember the first time i setup a rack of servers in a cage in a datacenter for a company i founded. We bought a block of IPs in bulk and then we bought an interconnect from a provider within the datacenter. To get those IPs pointing to our server we had our severs announce ownership over BGP. It s that easy.Usually BGP messages are filtered out by routers. Otherwise home users would announce ownership of the Google addresses and have all those messages come to them for example. But if you have access to an interconnect in a datacenter you can state you own whatever IP addresses you want. There s really nothing at all stopping it right now.

2019-11-19 16:13:08.000	A related issue is that software floating point must be used in the Linux kernel. Because floating point is rarely needed in kernel programming, FPU registers are not swapped when execution switches between kernel and user code. Instead, they re only switched when context switching between different processes using the FPU, and initially processes run with floating point instructions disabled. Basically it is almost always better to use integers when you canI d say understand the limitations of FP, but it s almost always better to use them unless you have some particular precision or performance requirement. Then again, my experience of FP is mostly in graphics, where IEEE 754 single precision is good enough for almost anything you d want, and hardware FP is commonplace.

2023-12-17 21:56:43.000	That would catch some legitimate use cases, where you get the list and immediately use it on the same line. Admittedly this is not so common for lists, but very common for struct readers, e.g. int i call.send .getSomeStruct .getValue Here, even though send returns a response that is not saved anywhere, and a struct reader is constructed from it, the struct reader is used immediately in the same line, so there s no use-after-free.Someone else mentioned using lifetimebound annotations. This will probably work a lot better, avoiding the false positives. It just hadn t been done because the annotations didn t exist at the time that most of Cap n Proto was originally written.

It may take time and be boring, but you have everything you need to solve it.Product-market-fit, customer acquisition, and etc. are often much more urgent difficult to solve, and we should focus on those first.What I ve seen in a lot of teams is tech debt or speculative tech debt if we move quickly is exaggerated to the point that they cannot launch quickly to acquire and iterate with customers, which is a huge mistake in product development.

2020-04-30 18:10:37.000	But barring shifting to a European model of college funding, I don t see the US allowing dischargeable loans, nor do I think they should, because the reality of it is that colleges won t reduce their rates nor increase their scholarships, they would just be completely out of reach of poor and middle class students.The reality is that the they should be out of reach to poor or middle class students TODAY. They are not serving those people and are actively making their lives worse by saddling them with outrageous debt and no prospect of meaningful employment.If the US changed bankruptcy it would force the colleges to change as well. Lenders are not going to be sending children into the workforce with zero chance to recoup that loan, and they are not going to want to bloat the college stay to ridiculous proportions.

I mean stuff that I ve used to solve with SQL databases before.My point is it is always a good idea to have a larger perspective.

2018-10-07 23:57:05.000	Exchanges facilitate liquidity between crypto and other common currencies. This has obvious value.

2012-04-24 17:08:29.000	Not sure why that would be, surely while Apple dictates their asking price they don t dictate financed price do they? So that s a self-inflicted wound, and one which carriers could fix by financing the phone less.The fact is that margins are down at Sprint, Verizon and AT T because of the iPhone.Last quarter quarter, AT T s and Verizon s profits are up because of lower iPhone sales think Apple won t be too happy with it s primary device more expensive than 199 on contract as that s the sweet spot and any increase will cut into sales.Apple s stock is down about 13 in two weeks because the carriers are getting tired of razor thin margins on iPhones while Apple laughs all the way to the bank and are pushing back. Not to mention the lower sales of iPhones this quarter.
2015-03-21 01:03:51.000	IMHO, the bigger concern is the exploits that the wider community hasn t found yet. How many nasty tricks were out there in Stuxnet for years before anybody noticed? Just given the scale of the stuff that s been found, I m inclined to think that trying to out-secure organizations with that kind of resources is a losing battle.You re better of not being somebody anyone would invest that kind of effort to hack. Or at least making your traffic not identifiable as somebody that your opponent would want to hack.Last I checked, holders of large amounts of Bitcoin tend to avoid letting their identity be associated with their accounts easily, and that s probably why. I bet somebody would be willing to risk a few 100k exploits to get a few million worth of BTC.

And I would agree, I find a surprising number of people think C is easy because it doesn t contain that many built-in constructs, and then get completely stuck when they try to use it. To get really good at C, you need a very solid understanding of common and effective patterns you can use. You can still write C without such things, but it quickly becomes a mess of random patterns and inconsistencies. And unfortunately, I can t really think of one source you can really point to for learning them though admittedly I haven t really looked into it tons .

It will break millions of sites needlessly. Most installations of lets encrypt plugins aren t going to auto update to v2. A lot of us are also using custom v1 code for various reasons that may not be easy to change.The preferable end-of-life date for ACMEv1 sparing any existential security issues should be never. Otherwise you will be executing a Geocities-sized web meltdown every time you phase out a version of the API.

Signal has fought at least one and won we can only know about ones they ve won against.Plus say you use Signal, how are you connecting? If that s through an app store then your binary has been replaced. A similar thing happened with Hushmail and their client side pgp jar file you have to consider the sealed-sender stuff, and other metadata. If your crime group isn t specializing in tech crime in general then outsourcing to a third-party that could use the Signal code internally probably makes more sense then trying to figure this stuff out yourself.

Hamlet finds himself caught up in a moral drama Did his uncle murder his father? Did his mother knowingly condone the act or is just wrong to marry her husband s brother? Is his love interest betraying him by reporting on his behaviour? etc, etc. Hamlet eventually determines he will endeavour to step outside it, but unfortunately doesn t succeed and gets drawn back in, resulting in more violence and his own death.The best answer to moral drama is often to try to rise above it, not by ignoring it but by addressing it from a higher moral level.

2014-10-09 19:43:19.000	Is that shallow processing or the presumption of coherence? People frequently say things using linguistic shorthands that are literally nonsense, and we are only able to communicate because we routinely impose a generous interpretation on statements that would otherwise be incoherent. Since the literal interpretation of Should a man be allowed to marry his window s sister? makes no sense, reading it incorrectly in a way that does make sense makes sense.

2013-11-05 23:21:19.000	How so? Can you explain how you think Scala isn t sound typesafe?Because you can do casts, and it s not pure. It doesn t even enforce immutability. You know what? Forget about enforcing it doesn t even make mutability or casts hard. Look, Haskell is certainly not my cup of tea. Personally, I don t think the effort of thinking about my program twice once in terms of logic and once in terms of types is worth it in most circumstances, and pure functional languages don t support concurrent data structures which is what I deal with the most. But I do recognize Haskell s elegance, and if the elaborate type system is worth it, it s only because it can enforce many guarantees. I mean, the whole point of Haskell is that it supposedly makes safer programs. So you pay for the elaborate types though some consider it a plus , but you gain safety. With Scala you just pay. Uhm, can you explain to me an example of a simple OO type system that is just powerful enough ?Sure. C , Java, C . Almost all of the world s software is written in C or Java. The question is not which language has the best type system and even if it were, Scala can t make up its mind because it s got three of them . A type system is not an end but a means. Practically everyone who deals with type systems agrees that they come at a cost and Martin Odersky himself admitted as much . But the cost hopefully buys you something. It arguably buys you better design, and it definitely buys you safety. Well, Scala doesn t give you safety any more than C or Java, and as for design, it can t even pick one type system a cornerstone of great design is that you have to make hard choices.

2023-03-21 17:13:43.000	Kind of. It gets you close.With the Builder pattern, you can easily define complex relationships for your class inner state. Like maybe if A B are specified, then C shouldn t be specified. But if C is specified, then D should have a default value. Etc.These types of initialization requirements are not easily duplicated with C init-only construction. Instead, in C you have to rely on the callers to know exactly how to correctly instantiate your class, including all the complex logic like in the example above.So yes, C init-only setters are kind of the best option you have. You can still create a C FooBuilder for a Foo class. But generally C programmers want to go out of their way to directly instantiate a Foo, and the number of bugs you get from this is crazy. It s a culture thing, honestly, not as much a language problem.My two cents.

2022-02-17 01:21:17.000	In fact, we can play that game right now. The SHA256 hash 1 of mlyle is CAD9051E126DA9BC7CB4048C4CA28804CCFEE0E3824F4E63FC151BC5E30B96D0 .

Ideally the shortest password using letters, numbers, and symbols in US ASCII, but honestly I ll take any binary string.Just to note this is not the game.The game is, given a bunch of bits of the hash output, identify which of a known set of input produces that hash output.Identifying which word in usr share dict words has the hash 0f??????????????????????????????9d??????d2??????????????????????is trivial.Yes, enumerating all possible 14 character passwords is impractical... but if it was a 10 character password input, it again would be trivial.The point is, the hints make it possible to know whether you ve got the correct answer. You have an oracle, that tells you whether a given password you re considering is correct.

2014-12-20 22:31:05.000	Your point is of course correct within the confines of the current market system. Is the current system moral though? I would argue it isn t. The system is designed to bolster the rich s coffers countries and getting rich people healthy, whilst poor countries are unable to pay.These countries can t afford to pay for such investment. The capital imbalance is just huge.Here s my take on this any drug that is developed by country A has to sell that drug at a rate related to countries B s GDP ratio to A, or allow an open generic license to country B. Thus, should a firm decide to charge 1000 a pill in the US, they have to charge a proportionate and fairer amount to a country like Bangladesh.Whether better access to health services and drugs, many of these third world countries would start to move out of the more that they are currently in. Of course there a huge numbers of variables but I as a share holder would prefer not to see children dying of diseases that could be prevented if it wasn t expensive.Naturally firms like Gilead are going to use market economics to determine the correct price for each country anyway. Something is better than nothing right? Generics are more a solution for long running patents, which I m personally against when it comes to drug development.

If we assume that the goal of the absolute function is to always produce positive real numbers, the function is missing something to deal with imaginary components.I m not sure, but based on these cases so far, maybe you just need to drop the i in the same way as you need to drop the negative in the case of non-imaginary components. Now, drop the i is not an actual function so maybe there is something else that you can think of?EDIT Maybe could do this works for x i at least... abs x sqrt sqrt x 2 2 Now.. how about quaternions...

2019-11-07 01:42:38.000	The article quotes Miles Brundage If it is not being used in an illicit fashion, A.I. can be a boon for generating larger, more ambitious, more creative text documents similar to how calculators have been used to help develop the skills we want to be teaching. and it continues Calculators have spared maths and science students the laborious pain of long calculations and allowed for more advanced syllabuses, designed with the knowledge that students will have access to calculators when answering them.The issue I have with this is that the role of the essay in education is not comparable to that of the sort of tasks that calculators automate. If there is an analog of calculators in essay-writing, it would be things like grammar-correctors and style checkers.If AI could be used in the manner envisioned in the quote, we could end up with people writing essays that they do not understand, and presenting arguments for positions that they could not defend.

2012-09-13 14:13:56.000	If I m reading it correctly, I think the idea is, imagine your bank uses a hash-cache of an AJAX request containing your bank statements stupid, yeah, but everyone is stupid sometimes .A malicious website could then include a request to download a bogus URL from their site with a hash which matched that of the bank statement AJAX response. The browser would then return the cached bank statement, without ever noticing the URLs were bogus or didn t even point to a file with the desired hash. The malicious website could then upload the bank statements back to itself.This seems like technically an attack path, but it relies on being able to guess a 256-bit hash in a relatively small number of guesses if you can do that, you might as well just start guessing password hashes and log in to a target website directly.

Every evening, before settling into his writing or reading, he d visit the same cafe in le marais, always occupying the same seat by the window. The cafe was nondescript, but apparently Benjamin was drawn to it due to an old, barely functional gramophone they had, uncommon for the time. he would usually request the barista to play a record. The gramophone had a quirk. it played every record slightly slower than it should, making it sound a bit more melancholicApparently Benjamin walked in one night to find another patron sitting in his favorite spot. most would ve taken another seat, but benjamin, ever the stickler for his rituals, decided to wait.He ordered a coffee and stood near the entrance, patiently waiting, occasionally glancing at the unaware man who was engrossed in a newspaper.The minutes turned into hours. the sun set, and the cafe s dim lights were starting to cast shadows. Benjamin s coffee went cold, etc. Meanwhile the patron showed no signs of leaving. and just when it seemed like benjamin would finally give up and break his ritual, the man stood up, folded his newspaper, and began to walk out. but, not before stopping by the gramophone, placing a coin, and letting it play a tune.Anyway the record, due to the gramophone s quirk, played one of Benjamin s own radio broadcasts in its distorted way. Supposedly this is the event that really got him thinking about the effects of reproduction of art and media more broadly

2020-07-01 11:38:23.000	Can you point out exactly where the contradiction is? What does deep into life process even mean?The problem here is modern science only looks at what can be measured. Life has parts which can not be measured and thus are missed by science. This is the same when you ask to define something - what if there is something which is not possible to define in words but at the same time one can experience it? It is still science but not modern, physical, measurable science.

2020-07-07 16:59:02.000	City planners often find it difficult to judge how cities feel. Are they happy or sad? What are they happy or sad about as well. It can only really be done through polls. This is an attempt to get around the difficulty of polling.Not perfect, doesn t solve any major problems. There can be many major improvements, such as data cleaning no astroturf detection for instance . But, I think this is a pretty cool tool that, in the right hands and with the right improvements, can really help city planners.

2018-10-18 09:33:16.000	In the same way, not wanting to let the police have this technology due to concern of surveillance is appealing to fear.People forget that, in the USA at least, the police investigate and pursue crimes that have already been committed. They do NOT pursue crimes that have not happened and do NOT scan for people who have not committed a crime. As you all should know, license plate scanners, for example, are looking for specific plates of people who have already committed crimes.

Along with the name change, the company pivoted to pushing high interest 12.5 loans on students.The ISAs also underwent dramatic changes. They now last up to eight years, max out at 42k, and apply to any job, whether or not it s tech. You could attend the program for a few months, drop out once you realize it s a disaster, get a job four years later as a truck driver, and end up on the hook for your full ISA.

I ve been able to find every book I was looking for at the British Library, but you have to request each book and can only read it there.Having said that, the books I was reading there were mostly general programming books. I don t know if they have more specific technical books.The British Library also has some scary note on their website about how you need to demonstrate why you need access. But that s not worth worrying about. I just went there and signed up, nobody asked me to justify why I want to read books there.

What I do not understand, considering the above Julian years and days have been used for a long time in respectively paleontology and astronomy, haven t they ? as well as from TFA Abolishing leap seconds will be helpful for users that have very tight accuracy requirements. UTC is the only timescale that is provided by national laboratories in metrologically traceable manner, i.e. in a way that provides real-time access, and allows users to demonstrate exactly how accurate their timekeeping is. TAI is not directly traceable in the same way it is only a paper clock, published monthly in arrears in Circular T as a table of corrections to the various national timescales. See the explanatory supplement for more details .So, what are we waiting for to just have both scientific time and civil time being broadcast separately and scientific time with more precision and frequency, not less ! , and then you use one or the other as appropriate ?
2015-03-02 20:47:42.000	As a rule, HTTP GET requests should not modify server state.

It doesn t mean it s a fork of git.
2015-10-15 16:29:23.000	The statistical hypothesis in the OP seems sound...for those of you who ve had to pitch studies like these and apply for funding on any topic ...does the institutional reluctance to fund these studies scale disproportionately to the proposed cost per participant and total possible participants?i.e. is it easier to convince the university funder to do a study that could potentially connect with 6,000 students at just 5 a piece, versus a study that, at most, could reach 600 students at 50 a piece?edit My guess is -- yes, that it is easier to convince people, even at the university level, with nicer sounding numbers even if competing proposals add up to the same cost, even if the cheaper broader-sounding proposal is scientifically less valid, because in general, people have difficulty with numerical reasoning. I mean, the OP felt the need and may have been asked to by the WaPo editor to describe cross-multiplication, something we all were supposed to have learned in elementary school But even if the response rate is not 100 percent, it allows us to place a lower bound on how many students have been assaulted. For example, if 90 percent of students respond to the survey, and 20 percent of them say they have been assaulted, we can infer that at least 90 percent x 20 percent 18 percent of students have been assaulted, even if none of the students who failed to respond were.

2022-11-16 22:30:23.000	School projects and super-handy things like being able to print coloring pages on-demand for most any topic one can think up, are probably a big part of why they re still so common. It is so damn nice to have a printer if you have kids of most any age.I ve also yet to find a superior UI to printed pages for running RPGs. Books are great, iPads are great, laptops can be OK, but for the core material you need for a given session, there s nothing in the world I know of that beats 20-30 pages of printed notes and excerpted bits of PDF books some randomly-generated junk from the Web for each session, so you have only expected-to-be-relevant info in it. Nothing better when you re actually at the table. I mean, you could do the same thing writing it by hand if you have very neat handwriting, but being able to mix together your own notes and e.g. NPC template-blocks, custom maps, and commercial material pulled from books, is awesome and saves tons of time when prepping. You can achieve something similar with just an iPad, but it s still slower and more awkward to actually use though I do have other things I use tablets for at the table, that they excel at.

But the tone of the post makes it sound a little bit like they spent a bit too much of those 9 vcs money on coke.The super-stealthiness is going to be a big problem here, frankly. The kind of developers that they claim to want to hire can work anywhere they want. They are choosing where to work based on being able to do work which is meaningful and interesting.

2013-02-14 18:44:12.000	They are obviously not a charity company and its totally understandable the need to make revenue. However, when i sign up for a service and i am asked to link to an external JavaScript file, i expect that file to do as advertised, i can understand the functionality changing a bit without me being notified but not when they do such drastic changes, in that case they should either go with an opt-in option or disable there commenting system until i approve that i am okay with this new functionality. For all those that say you can stop using them if you don t like what they do , of course you can but there malicious code still rendered on my webpages right? As an example, what if tomorrow they added functionality to there widget and they started forcing pop ups, would that be okay? There is a certain level of trust needed towards a company that wants me to link some external code on my website that they can change at any given time, actions like that destroy said trust.Here is the thing, if they done it the proper way i am sure most people wouldn t opt-in, if you are running a website that makes a revenue from ads, you probably already have all the ads your webpage can support , if you are running a website as a hobby you probably aren t interested to make any sort of revenue so you would rather not have the ads. Its way more profitable for them to just force there way in, specially if they see that there users don t care.

2017-04-26 21:44:11.000	I ve never been to a conference.I was interested in an upcoming conference related to some technology I have been working with, so I decided to calculate what it would cost to attend. The fee to attend the conference was not outrageous, but I would have to fly to the location and find lodging for 3 nights.I decided I could probably do it for about 1,000 if everything went well.Then I realized that I would probably be able to just watch the videos on youtube afterward. Since I wouldn t know any of the people in attendance and my knowledge of this technology would barely let me converse with experts, it seems like a simple choice.So if you re hosting a conference, how do you convince people to spend a significant portion of their yearly salary and miss several days of work instead of staying at home?

2023-08-16 08:56:58.000	They actually used clojure which is an interesting choice.GC tuning on the JVM is much less of a topic these days than it used to be. The default garbage collector was changed at some point G1 . It has some configuration options but they come with sane defaults that mostly just work fine and adapt to your memory and cpus. You don t spend a lot or any time on tuning this typically. I know I haven t even looked at GC params in many years now. Never had to. And we run on modestly sized vms of 1 or 2 GB typically. This was different 10 or so years ago when G1 was still newish and not default. ZGC was introduced with Java 11 I think , and aimed at very large heaps. It trades off additional overhead for guaranteeing very low latency. That tradeoff is why it is not default. For most users, G1 without any tuning whatsoever should be fine. Generally, if you are stressing your heap, you get more hardware. And if you are not, the GC should be keeping up just fine.Anyway, like it or not, the JVM has been a work horse for big data for ages. Things like Hadoop, Kafka, Cassandra, Elasticsearch, etc. all run on it and scale fine and typically without a lot of GC tuning . The only feasible alternative to the jvm used to be things like C . Lately, Go and Rust are pretty credible in this space as well and both have had to do a bit of catchup in terms of maturity of tooling, libraries, and language features. Things like generics Go , async Rust , etc. are still fairly recent additions and both kind of relevant in a project of this type.In any case, switching languages is hard for teams and these guys have been around for quite some time. When they started, Rust was a lot less mature than it is now and Go was still pretty new as well. Neither was an obvious choice for this stuff at the time.

They may not be penniless or destitute a lot of times, people have no home, but they have a cell phone to charge, and they have a few bucks to spend on restaurant food because they can t purchase store groceries or cook for themselves .So all these creature comforts and amenities attract people of lower economic class. Often it s really nice to use a lab computer, set your phone down while it s charging, get on the Internet and do some job searches. If there s a café in your library, then you can stay all day without leaving.Even people who do have homes may prefer the library during the day. If they have obnoxious roommates, abusive family members, no A C or heating, whatever, they can come to the library and enjoy all that, courtesy of the taxpayers.

2022-12-08 16:54:56.000	Some people feel that extreme sentences are deterrents, but studies show that people don t rationally calculate the expected value of their punishment. Almost nobody committing crimes thinks they ll get caught, so doubling jail time doesn t have much of a deterrent effect.Almost everyone who commits crimes while expecting to get caught is in desperate circumstances near starvation, jail preferable to available housing, loved one in big trouble, etc. , where the time isn t a big deterrent, either.It s much more effective to increase at least the perception of the probability crimes will be caught and prosecuted. Excessive jail sentences presumably result in greater costs, meaning less money available on the investigation and prosecution side. Yes, this makes faulty assumptions about how government budgeting works in practice.

2021-03-12 05:31:44.000	As it is, typical home electrical systems have no active components. There are just wires, panels and bimetallic circuit breakers. These systems are nearly maintenance-free over a lifespan similar to that of the structure.A DC distribution system in the home would require both a high power rectifier at the main panel to something like 125 VDC, then many smaller DC DC converters throughout the home for your usable voltages like 5 9 15 20 V that are too low to be effectively distributed.All of those things would need to be maintained and upgraded over the years, because there is no such thing as power electronics that last forever. After a few electrician visits, you might find that you haven t saved any money at all.Even if you have solar, you still need a DC converter because it will not output a constant voltage let alone all of the DC voltages you need for your devices. And generation any further away than your own rooftop is going to need to be stepped up to higher-than-home voltages and then back down for use in your home - all of which is exactly why we currently use AC for distribution.

Are there some domains where implicit parallelism is such a killer feature that you would sacrifice all other library compatibility and tooling to acquire it? Or is this more of a research language, intending to explore compiler techniques in language API design under an interesting set of constraints?

2013-03-24 04:05:55.000	I would argue in favor of lower taxation on producers lower taxation on everything, with a Federal government at least 1 4 smaller by focusing strictly on key priorities . I d argue for a government matching the Bill Clinton era size, adjusted appropriately for 13 years, and the taxes to go with it.My point was emphasis on production is extremely lacking in the US today. Presidents pay lip service to it and absolutely nothing else , meanwhile China is beating our pants off by actually focusing on it. My other point was, production is more important than consumption because the one must come before the other, not to say you don t need consumption of course .You turn on the TV and every talking head says the same thing consumption is 2 3 of the economy. So in their world we need more consumer spending - more people buying junk they don t need from China so China can get richer while we get poorer. When you put that into a logical context, it s comically absurd. Where do those talking heads think the money to consume comes from? 100 of it comes from production or credit, with the ability to spend being a left-over fractional fruit of production aka the profit from producing something .

Of course, it has disclaimers related to use by using the software, you agree with the liability disclaimers, but you don t have to agree with anything else just to be a user. Users are free not to share their modifications.

2018-02-09 19:01:47.000	Writing software is not difficult. Anyone can do it. The hard part is learning to structure your thinking such that the software you will be writing will actually solve a problem as it currently exists in a cost-effective way.With that skill, you don t even always need to know how to write software programs. Sometimes, you re better off delegating specific tasks to humans.When someone hands you a problem like make this dead elephant disappear other people will still be scratching their heads after the programmer has already figured out while elephant.mass 0 eater.TakeABite elephant And they think to themselves, I can vanish an elephant in two lines. Everyone else is still thinking about the problem in terms of tons. The chewing and swallowing is a trivial implementation detail. Meanwhile, some other programmer will be at the north pole wondering what happened to the elephant they left in Cairo. Some people simply aren t able to deal with problems they have not encountered before, that are too far beyond their domain of comfort. They can learn, but they don t innovate. As long as such people exist, they will have to pay other people to teach them how to cope with changes in their environment. Software engineers get paid well because a lot of them can effectively solve problems without needing to be domain experts in anything.

2012-05-30 14:41:29.000	That s a slightly glossed over interpretation of thermodynamics. Perhaps photovoltaics have a higher theoretical efficiency than a thermal cycle plant, but in practice they don t. Thermal cycle power plants are the mainstay of our power generation - nuclear, coal, gas, geothermal - all those power sources make use of a steam based heat to work cycle. We ve got 100 years of experience in developing thermal cycle power. Peak photovoltaic efficiency is currently 20 , while most affordable cells are closer to 10-15 . A simple cycle thermal plant might have an efficiency of 30-40 . It ll be some time before photovoltaics are more efficient for a given area of collecting space.Cost is a different question. Photovoltaics have fallen dramatically in cost recently. As the space taken up by a solar plant isn t really an issue the collecting area could take up 10 times more space without really impacting anything , the winner in solar energy will be the cheapest option per kWh.

The new feature does exactly what s written in the blog post if a string literal contains only UTF-8 characters and you assign it to a byte array or span, it gets encoded as UTF-8. It s just syntactical sugar.This is a post about C 11 the language, not the framework or the runtime. It s only telling you about what the compiler does when it encounters some syntax.

The tax does not apply to all earnings, only the earnings over a threshold.

2019-08-30 01:29:17.000	I use Perl in my day job and enjoy it a lot, but the biggest showstopper for me is that its greatest strength is its greatest weakness. There s more than one way to do it , it s amazing at getting things working, it excels at writing glue programs to shim between bigger and slower moving parts, especially if they re throwaway hacks.However all that flexibility means that it s not possible to run static analysis with full confidence. Yes, tools exist - but it s been proven impossible for them to catch all cases, and this uncertainty carries real risks for critical business processes.When you have a code base encompassing a set of core modules, with hundreds of auxiliary programs using them across the business, then any attempt to update perl or its modules grinds to a halt. It s impossible to even enumerate which programs will be impacted by the change with confidence, let alone the effects of such a change.For details see Perl Cannot Be Parsed A Formal Proof You can mitigate the impact with coding style guides and code reviews but once the damage is done it s very difficult to untangle an existing code base that loads modules at run-time and makes full use of Perl s flexible nature in other ways.

2024-07-28 16:42:39.000	Utterly banal. For one thing, to say that life supervenes upon chemistry which supervenes upon physics is actually taking the _opposite_ position than life is emergent, at least to the extent that philosophers agree about what emergent means. I understand emergence to mean what Deacon means the properties of the emergent system are independent from the properties of the system underneath it at least to the extent that you couldn t predict the behavior of the emergent system with just the physics, at least not without a lot of work and the specific initial conditions required. The idea being that many possible systems could serve as the basis for the emergent system and that the emergent system is some kind of set of self-reinforcing constraints imposed on the underlying system.As it happens, I don t believe this argument if taken all the way. Sure, emergence has the property that, in some sense, one knows more about the emergent system if it is described at its own level rather than at the level of the underlying system eg, if you tell me you are hungry I m much more likely to correctly predict you will order pizza than if you give me a catalog of the state of all your neurons , but your behavior still supervenes upon the neurons inexorably. Even the constraints that maintain the emergent system ultimately are expressed in terms of the underlying system.

2021-11-20 19:23:44.000	If cloud_vendor doubled their prices tomorrow, what are you going to do ? If cloud_vendor decided to kill-off a product tomorrow and replace it with another one with a different API, what are you going to do ?Been using AWS for close to 10 years now and I don t recall them doing anything remotely similar to above. Of course, they could potentially do it in the coming days. But going by their past behaviour I d say it s a low probability event.When the cloud AWS was new these fears were indeed valid. But this line of reasoning is getting old and tiring especially when it s not backed by even anecdotal evidence and is purely speculative-fear in nature.I do know that Google, Twitter and others have pulled down some fairly popular APIs products but please don t conflate that with GCP AWS cloud offerings.For most of the startups it s not even a question of if cloud now. Early days 2010-2015ish it used to be the case that engineers had to convince management about the advantages of cloud. Primarily because one had to mostly go hybrid as many of the services weren t in cloud yet such as Route 53, RDS etc., . It was a pain to maintain hybrid. Now it s possible to run 100 of tech stack in cloud. So it s the other way round VCs and business folks will frown upon tech if they run on bare-metal data-centre.
2023-07-14 13:24:41.000	So senior scientists are not working for the good of humanity, but are embedded in a system that is thoroughly corrupted by power.Science in itself can be a useful tool for gaining knowledge. All scientific knowledge builds on earlier knowledge. But when it is no longer possible to discern which knowledge was created for the honest pursuit of truth and conscience and which for pure power interests, the whole foundation collapses.As long as the extent of this corruption is not known, one should treat every scientific finding with the greatest scepticism, because the findings are no longer trustworthy. Especially those that find wide and welcome dissemination in the media and politics.This should be kept in mind under all circumstances if one wants to continue listening to the narratives about the climate apocalypse that are excellently placed in the media. For here, too, the exact same propaganda mechanisms are used alleged consensus among all scientists and dissenting opinions are defamed as conspiracy theories and right-wing narratives. Anyone who thinks they will find honest discourse and argumentative competition here should have been taught better by now.But I have already given up hope. Humanity will make the same mistake again and again.

2022-01-10 13:42:30.000	We ve been hearing about the genocide and reeducation camps in Xinjiang for many years. How long did they actually cover it up for? I believe they actually post propaganda videos from the reeducation camps themselves.
2019-09-24 22:48:34.000	That is an interesting idea. What kind of performance could we expect, especially in the federated case of searching multiple buckets? Elastic has sub-second latency at the cost of running dedicated containers .

2016-10-22 06:58:20.000	I think even basic home routers these days, have enough cpu power to handle egress filtering.If you have an iot device, by its nature it only needs to connect to a few services and hosts.The manufacturer can provide this in their docs, and give an automatic config url that the router uses to load its egress rules.The rules to load are displayed and the user checks they are legit by comparing to the printed version in the manual, then clicks ok. Or something like that.Rate limits in terms of packets per second, total bandwidth both instantaneous and over time, are set also.
2017-10-13 20:23:48.000	Exactly. My point was more that the OO patterns refer to general concepts, that are useful to be able to recognize without objects cluttering your view.I believe we re on the same page
2022-04-02 15:44:56.000	yeah, this is actually something we are looking at for the Saab T5 engine series. It uses an integrated coil pack for all the cylinders, which in turn means, a failure of one is a failure of all. I know some of the tuners have switched to using more normal coil pack setups, but unfortunately the T5 system is pretty unique so its not a thing that can be easily hot swapped.One interesting tidbit is the coil packs run a bit of current over the plug when it s not sparking to measure ionization to determine engine conditions i think mostly knock

I could see it being quite easy for people in China whose job it might be to prevent the export of fentanyl or fentanyl precursors to only do the minimum to keep up appearances. not nearly as blatant as the British but were but we aren t getting any help from China in preventing the deadly drugs from being shipped here. It would be better if they would just send actual heroin instead of having casual mdma and cocaine users dying from fentanyl. 1

2022-03-03 16:01:33.000	well i confess there is a difference between brainwashed and braindead, given the result of latest USA election i think we are more facing braindead peoples.Which could have a clear biological explanation as far as USA is the most diabetic country in the wolrd and diabete leads to Alzheimer that some specialists call diabete Type3 .Associated with third world education system, and high level of self esteem, it s easy to brainwash braindead peoples such as USA citizen.We all remember this Collin Powell little bottle of Anthrax.But what surprise me more is how true american can be so proud of themselve as far as they are such liitle dog of Israel...

Fred s post also mentions the challenge of how to manage a social site, e.g., Reddit, that depends on a lot of volunteer workers. 2 Fred is highly interested in nearly everything about BitCoin and blockchains. 3 Fred runs a popular blog, AVC.com, and he regards it as an important part of his business as a VC. In this blog, Fred sees himself as a bartender who watches as others interact.In addition, IMHO, Fred likes to toss out ideas that are easy to comment on because they are deliberately incomplete and can easily be made more complete or deliberately not very good or very well supported so that they can easily be improved on.So, he tossed out something about social site management and the blockchain. From 50,000 feet up, the point of mentioning a blockchain for site management is that a blockchain can be distributed in various respects.In particular, with that post, Fred kept up interest in social sites, one of his favorite ideas, a large collection of engaged users that can form a barrier to entry, and blockchain. And he got some thoughtful comments.Some of the commenters may have spent more time on their comments than Fred did on his post!

It s not the fixing of problems that are newly created but the fixing of defects that were there all along. Plus, the incentive here is backwards in the most degenerate case, companies are incentivized to sell things as buggy as possible in order to sell the most bug fix subscriptions possible.
2017-07-07 12:29:33.000	Not using native widgets concepts and single threaded are two distinct problems.Single JS threads restricts your business logic a lot. If you start doing any serious work in JS, your app will suffer greatly.Regarding native components, the result is that views just don t look native, animations are not native even down to different timing functions , view behaviors are different the RN button fade out on tap is different than UIButton, etc .On top of that, since the JS thread is responsible for UI rendering and business logic, if your JS thread is busy, UI is stuck , being unable to rerender until the JS thread is freed.All these issues pile up to create a bad result at the end. Add to that the human element not always being mindful of performance implications , and it is worse. But, definitely, the ceiling is very low at how much you can achieve.I say all these things from experience I work next to a team of dedicated RN developers at my company. In many cases, the need to drop to native is apparent and necessary, which makes the point of RN moot.Certainly, RN is better than Cordova no doubt about that. But it s just not as good as many people want to fool themselves at believing.

Don t make the depth of color a big goal.

2015-05-17 10:28:41.000	I m talking about the Monad style in general, with the do notation, closures and what have you. Typically such things add an interpretive overhead, in the same way that a formatting print function adds interpretive overhead unless it is implemented with a macro, some kind of metaprogramming technique to evaluate and inline the interpretive component, or other techniques. I ve read that the monadic style in Haskell has this kind of overhead, which is further pronounced with monad stacks. Is that not the case?
2021-07-26 08:57:57.000	A little offtopic It s telling how you can tell the article was written by a mathematician, apart from the obvious fact that it s about mathematics. I m talking about the structure. For example How do mathematicians prove theorems? This question introduces an interesting topic, but to start with it would be to project two hidden assumptions 1 that there is uniform, objective and firmly established theory and practice of mathematical proof, and 2 that progress made by mathematicians consists of proving theorems It reminds me of a joke I was told by my math teacher when I was at school about how mathematics shapes your thought I may do a poor translation An air balloon traveller encounters very dense mist and gets lost and so is forced to descend to the ground, where he finds a guy taking a walk. The traveller asks the guy Excuse me sir, could you tell me where am I? The guy, after a very long pause answers You are on a balloon . The traveller smiles and says You are obviously a mathematician . How do you know? asks the guy to which the traveller replies. Easy, there are three very good reasons. The first one is that you took a long time to answer, obviously considering just the facts and proceeding with strict logic. The second one is because the precision of your answer. And last but not least because your answer is useless

2023-05-23 15:33:22.000	Exceptions are ways to crash the program in a controlled manner with the ability for these crashes to be caught midway before the program crashes and handled correctly. In rust you can only crash it explicitly using the panic! Macro. No handling.You can catch Rust panics with catch_unwind if you compiled your program with -Cpanic unwind default on most platforms . Under the hood it uses stack unwinding, just like C and co s exceptions. But Rust doesn t consider this idiomatic error handling, it s only used in a few special situations test frameworks, web servers where one buggy session shouldn t take down the process... .
2022-10-31 11:05:19.000	It completely ignores that the port number abstraction for service identification has completely failed due to the industry glomming onto HTTP as some sort of universal tunnel encapsulation for all application-layer protocols. And then there s all the non-backend problems!The paper argues the in 3.1 Stream orientation section, that stream orientation is a problem for TCP, and says that most apps send messages instead, and the better protocol should handle messages, natively, etc. Which is a good point I think.But back to TCP. What do you do, if you need to send Messages between applications in TCP? Preferably those Messages would be encrypted also.You could make up your own protocol, but you probably would rather not! So you use something that is readily available, and does messages, encryption, etc. Would be nice if there were also a ready to use load balancers, caches, tools to debug it, etcNow, what would be such a protocol.Why HTTPS, of course.So I kind of think that the lack of a low level Message Protocol has lead us, as an industry, to coalesce these features bit-by-bit on top of HTTP. It s not perfect by any means, but it does the job.

Otherwise wait to see what arises from the Amigo Review. If the reviewer asks any questions, answer them with comments. Once the reviewer stops asking questions then the code is sufficiently commented.
2024-03-22 15:16:00.000	It was trivially easy to set up Yuzu or Ryujinx to play switch games that haven t even launched yet without even owning a switch. That definitely has some sort of impact on Nintendo s business.More importantly Yuzu was known to essentially have a culture of not caring about the DMCA themselves. I don t think they did anything illegal in the emulator code but they did totally have a private pirated game stash and were selling TOTK compatible builds via Patreon before the game released which violates basically every rule of clean room disassembly.

2018-12-26 14:18:42.000	Your first thought has no explanation in it. Maybe they simply have a growing middle class and thus soon their economic activities in the west that we gladly consume would become hindered by their own growth, so they re looking for their equivalent of what China was to the west in the 90 s and 00 s and their own regions are not viable for that, just like manufacturing in rural USA didn t work for the west. If that s wrong, how can you live with yourself? Or is it wrong simply because this time it s China doing it? Isn t that hypocritical?Edit I would appreciete if people stopped downvoting for asking a question. That s not how you discuss.
2009-05-19 05:04:06.000	I ve felt similarly, but I found that part of the problem was that I was seeking acceptance and participation from my friends, even though I was occupying myself with increasingly specific and esoteric things. Part of the solution was just caring less what other people think, and mentioning to them only the pretty nifty cool engaging things that I work on, not the theoretical stuff.Another good tip is that, with some time and effort, you can largely shape the kind of new friends you meet, especially today with the web. You could organise some informal gettogethers, interest groups, lectures, etc. Providing free beer helps a lot. Leverage your workplace, your school, your local watering hole. Hunt for people who are doing the same things you do. Blog about what you do, so others can find it. These days, you can automate a lot of this just by setting up search feeds on Google, Twitter, etc. Even on something as noisy as Twitter, there s someone talking about fluid dynamics, linguistics, philosophy, etc. Find them, see what places they link to, and join their communities so you can find out where they hang out in real life. The trick is to not treat the online world as a separate place where the cool people hang out , but simply the medium through which cool people hook up . Most of the people you want to hang out with are in the same boat as you bored, alone and online.The fact is that you are less likely to meet someone truly interested in your pursuits than just regular nice people . Accept this, but make sure you are ready to encounter these special people and show them, very quickly, that you are a smart person worth getting to know and worth having in depth conversations with.Also, though the hacker lifestyle has its perks, it never hurts to expand your interests to include more outdoor activities. Often you can be as intellectual and nerdy about those as you want, without suffering the nerd penalty.As for correcting people on urban legends people don t like being told they re wrong and many people enjoy urban legends for the drama and excitement, because it gives them a story to tell. Often they don t really care if it s true or not.

2016-09-12 22:27:33.000	I agree with you. I suspect people think you re being sexist? I am a woman and if my husband drank so much soda I would lay down the law.I find it surprising and alarming in other people s relationships in America, anyway -- I noticed this was very different when I lived abroad how little each partner seems involved in the other s fitness and health. I ve heard oh, but they would get offended! or something. Like yes, that s certainly true with friends and strangers. But you have a major stake in your spouse s health. It s you who will take care of them when they are sick, you who will pay their way if they cannot work.I exercise with my husband, I eat well with my husband. We tell each other when we are getting extra pudge. I wouldn t have it any other way.

I ve also configured Firefox to block cookies by default only permitted sites can store cookies for the session, and just a handful I allow permanent cookies.Web pages load much quicker, Firefox uses less resources, my browsing is significantly more secure see 1 for risk of loading arbitrary fonts , and I can browse the web without Google Facebook AdvertizingCorp and thus the Five Eyes building a profile of everything I do. It s a nice feeling.This set up also blocks ads served from third parties, which I feel is an agreeable compromise on web advertising. If I send a request to your website, and you send me a document with embedded images stored on your website, I ll download them and view them alongside the page. However, if you try to tell me go send 5 unsecure requests to each of these three companies you ve never heard of, and execute their 20KB of code, to get flashing ads alongside this page - I ll ignore you.Sites loading resources from external domains usually Google is nothing new. I ve been browsing this way for two years now, and I ve developed a healthy level of contempt for 95 of web developers. The vast majority of them just don t care for their users campaigning to get the developers to change their habits is a broken model. Ultimately, you have to take control, and decide for yourself what you want to run on your computer.I don t know why more people don t browse this way some actually ridicule this approach get with the times . It boggles the mind. 1

Teachers actually read the whole thing and grade you based on what you have written.That s why it can take a few weeks to get the results. Not comparable to multiple choice stuff, which can be corrected by every first-grader.

Then you could find out exactly when your database was stolen. If all canaries up to 2009-01-01 were spammed, and later ones weren t, you d know they dumped your db on New Year s Day.Not sure how much that would help either though.

2023-10-24 22:07:28.000	Imagine you are in the middle of a custody battle when this news comes down, or that you are jailed before being cleared. Imagine the cops and social workers in your city aren t diligent, or that you already have a criminal record. And further imagine you don t have the luxury of a New York Times reporter investigating your case and writing publicly about how you re innocent. The NYT example is a best case outcome for an innocent person who triggers these algorithms.
2023-05-22 12:45:02.000	Thanks for sharing that sentiment. I don t quite take the same view on it but understand the approach can be effective. I stopped using slack at some point and it meant I did not speak to the specific group of friends who only communicated through slack. It turned out to be a so-so thing. In some ways I don t know whether it had more negative or positive impact. By taking a stance on it, maybe it was only detrimental to myself or beneficial, whichever way you see it.On the family front, there s a WhatsApp group and people have learned to use it for that activity, so I can t see that behaviour changing especially when 60 year olds are in it too. It just became the defacto mode of communication somehow. Yet funnily 10 years ago, I was not a WhatsApp user. A friend of mine dragged me on there. It reminds me of 2006 when people kept asking Are you on Facebook , like a bunch of drug addicts.I personally want to move some of my private content and conversations off public servers and on to one I control. Off public networks and on one I know I ve secured. That to me as an engineer now makes a lot of sense. But there s also a significant burden to that and I don t think anyone else can do it. Also I don t imagine anyone will setup VPN across my extended family. So there s some things to think through before trying anything.

2019-10-29 15:04:00.000	I wrote a similar tool 1 for a cybersecurity competition I was helping to red team for. It would try a dictionary of username and password combos against a list of hosts generated from the results of a masscan 2 , once it logged it it would run a bash script on the host to set up our persistence.From there it would keep a session open on each host and allow you to run commands on a single host, a subset of hosts, or all hosts.The advantage of this over hydra or some other SSH brute forcer is that it allows us to run our persistence tooling right away after finding a login and keep that SSH session alive so we can re-use it even if the password is changed.The code is a tire fire, but it worked well for what we needed 1

Someone goes to an event on startups and they are annoyed because no one handed them action items or facilitated their networking more?On the west coast it s mostly a matter of things arising from chaos. You do what you can in terms of nailing the logistics pizza, beer and fast moving lines but the meat is who you get into the room, not what the person at the microphone is saying.I m not saying YC and pg couldn t have made it better, the OP should be lauded for some of the critique. Criticism of YC tends to be controversial. But the OP seems to have accidentally discovered exactly some of the differences between east coast and west coast cultures.
2021-04-07 16:09:03.000	What they re actually tracking tends to be the fact you ve searched for productcategory whether you bought or not In theory since they also have purchase data their purchasing intent categories could exclude people who have subsequently purchased from productcategory for products which are substitutes but definitely not products which are complements consumables collectibles etc, because someone who has just bought guitar fishing accessories isn t just likely to buy more guitar fishing accessories again in future but a lot more likely to than the average person , and yes they could even make guesses about whether somebody is likely to want more than one office chair based on whether they re purchasing as a business or an individual. But in practice it s not easy when they ve got a product inventory that s so enormous, complex and dubiously-labelled even the basic product search doesn t work that well, and most of the time the vendors are paying them to show the ads anyway. And still wouldn t be perfect ironically I seriously considered buying two different vacuum cleaners for different use cases this week! It s surprising how bad basic targeting is, like when Facebook allowed ad targeting by sexual orientation but even dating websites spent vast sums without bothering, so its unsurprising subtle distinctions about which buyer types only need one of which office accessory are often missed.

2024-02-22 06:21:51.000	Humans don t have a recursive self-improvement abilityThey do.Humans can learn from new information, but also by iteratively distilling existing information or continuously optimizing performance on an existing task.Mathematics is a pure instance of this, in the sense that all the patterns for conjectures and proven theorems are available to any entity to explore, no connection to the world needed.But any information being analyzed for underlying patterns, or task being optimized for better performance, creates a recursive learning driver.Finally, any time two or more humans compete at anything, they drive each other to learn and perform better. Models can do that too.

2013-07-19 15:00:53.000	I would bet that any experts on this matter would advise the same thing leave them alone. Why do you think there are strict laws banning travel to the island?The people themselves have made it very clear that they want to be left alone. Your mentality is the same one that missionaries and conquistadors use to justify imperialistic domination. If they want to be left alone what gives you the right to impose your way of life?And if you actually read the article and do some basic research you would notice that the entire reason the island didn t become a mini zoo is because the Sentinelese people themselves have resisted intervention and subsequently there are laws banning intervention.You have such a western centric world police attitude it is pretty gross and pompous. You re basically suggesting destroying a culture we know nothing about because of some false sense of moral obligation. Rash, illogical decision making is what is wrong with this world, and that is exactly what you re advocating.
2019-07-17 23:32:29.000	There are many subtle and less subtle differences, but the main difference is that TLA is being used in the industry to help design complex systems in various domains and of various scale, both hardware and software, while dependent types are still in research, and I am not aware of any project not done by a research institution or with the assistance of one to specify and verify a real world system using dependent types in any form resembling ordinary software development and with similar budgets.

2010-03-09 23:58:51.000	Cost does not equate with energy.Back in the 1950 s, Freeman Dyson did a study on the cost of electricity. Electricity costs much more to use than to generate. If electricity were free there would be only about a 5 percent drop in the GNP. for not needing subsidies, there s a significant cost of capital beyond inflation, and there s also some risk due to its being a new technology. These dissuade investors.
2022-05-14 18:49:12.000	Something being difficult to legislate doesn t absolve the need for legislation.

2023-09-10 16:36:16.000	I can give you a counterexample anecdote from my own career I have spent my entire career writing code mainly in Common Lisp. I have a long list of successfully executed projects, some of which were done in the face of directly competing efforts written in other languages which failed spectacularly. I have a profound belief in Lisp, and I can justify that belief with a litany of empirical data and theoretical explanations. Nonetheless, every single time I have ever expressed that belief it has led to my career advancement being cut off and ultimately to the loss of my position and having to start over.So no, it s not enough to have profound beliefs . You have to have the right kind of profound beliefs unless you are extremely lucky -- see below . They have to not conflict too much with the profound beliefs of your management and co-workers because if they do you re sunk no matter how much data you have to back them up. That just turns out to be how the world works. I learned this lesson the hard way, and far too late in life for it to do me much good, but I thought I d pass it along.There is one exception to this rule, and that is if you just happen to get have iconoclastic beliefs that are also correct and you somehow manage to acquire the resources to act on those beliefs and the results you produce happen to find a large market. Steve Jobs is the poster child for this, and even he is a cautionary tale because his career very nearly ended when he was first fired from Apple. It was only the good fortune of Apple management being utterly incompetent that gave him a second chance, which he seized on to spectacularly good effect. But Jobs was literally one in a billion.

2024-09-12 15:36:17.000	Are we ever really going to understand why it produces the numbers it does?I would expect so, because we can categorize things hierarchically.A medium-sized library contains many billions of words, but even with just a Dewey decimal system and a card catalog you could find information relatively quickly.There s no inherent difficulty in understanding what a billion terms do, if you re able to just drill down using some basic hierarchies. It s just about finding the right algorithms to identify and describe the best set of hierarchies. Which is difficult, but there s no reason to think it won t be solvable in the near term.

And forget about doing anything else the system would hang hard until I O was cleared.By contrast, upgrading my desktop tower from HDD to SSD was an incredible, dramatic speedup in terms of booting and especially apt upgrades. The latter became nearly instantaneous. Blink and you miss them.Now, on the Pi I use only the heavy-duty brand-name sdcards. I have found that the weak ones tend to suffer badly from ESD. I am not sure how much lower performance is from the heavy-duty cards, but I doubt it is much slower than the fragile ones.

2021-07-08 12:07:30.000	I like ideas like this but in my current situation this is simply kinda dumb 0 When I code anything for fun I don t even need to try it, I m 100 sure I could use my 2004 laptop for this, it fits the specs except for too much ram and I played around with it as recently as last year.When I need to visit certain websites that will make the poor computer nearly explode, it s not a challenge for me, it s simply a horrible experience waiting 3 minutes for your page to load in Chrome, I tried it . Or I need to use lynx.For work.. I think I might even get by with just needing to wait 5x as long for the compiles. I will get by with using vim and grep instead of IntelliJ. The real problem would be Outlook for the Web and Slack, not the code. Maybe JIRA, not sure .But, worst of all, the things I actually enjoy, playing certain video games, that s the only thing that dies right in the water, because they won t run.So not sure if challenge is the correct word. Or my computing needs are simply not so high, most of the time. 0 Not sure how to phrase it better, I don t mean to disparage the idea, the author, or anyone doing that. I m simply _very_ confident that I can predict what will happen for me exactly, on a case by case basis - so it doesn t sound fun to take part.

Did does he also run his businesses in such as way so as to minimize them?Obviously there are approaches that make sense to be common to running both business and government that probably apply to most everything else as well because they d seem like common sense but, at a high level, to say run government like a business is one of those things that only sounds reasonable possibly until you think about it.

2021-10-19 15:30:47.000	Cryptocurrencies and financial sanctions are totally incompatible. I see this as one of the main drivers towards banning cryptocurrencies, with a side of saving the children , ransomware , and the environment . Decentralization and centralized power are enemies.There is a huge amount of innovation in the space for anyone who looks deeply, but most people won t and just jump on the bandwagon.
2017-04-05 13:09:59.000	You make it sound like speech hasn t always been a contest nothing about the freedom from government censorship implies anything else either. All you get with free speech , is the notion that the government can t thumb the scales with their immense power and influence having the ability to create and enforce laws .The problem does have a way to solve itself, but that probably involves the model we see here on HN, which admittedly is preferable to the model of a locale such as Reddit. That said, each platform is going to want to address the problem on a faster timeline, because the problem directly hits their bottom line.

We are growing regionally so that we can develop a traction at universities and guarentee a match. We can t do that yet in Washington DC.The position you are describing sounds great -- its paid, offers professional experience for someone interested in the field of research, the only question I would ask is if there is much interaction with you and other employees. If you added to the program a once a week coffee, where you or other experts in the office talked to the candidate for 30 minutes and offered context on how their work fit into a broader policy and research framework it would take the position to the next level and help you get superior candidates.

2017-05-26 11:42:07.000	In the first company I confounded, we recruited a friend of my cofounder to a senior job. He looked like the right guy for the job but he actually really wasn t. He was completely underperforming and junior employees looked at him and lost respect for both and my cofounder for keeping him on.Because he was a friend who had left his job to work for us, we didn t fire him and he continued undermining the company with his poor performance for a year. I think this was the worst mistake I did. In the end, he left the company and screwed us over on some account.So, I ve learned from this - do not hire friends as senior executive- if you insist on hiring friend, have a clear backup plan if things don t work out so that you can both end the relationship. Be prepared to lose your friendship in doing that.- never let an underperforming senior employee fester in your company. It s like rot, it will drag down the entire company by devaluating the work your other employees do

If your car was somehow supported only by party balloons on the rims, then their stiffness would contribute nothing and the calculation would be spot on.On the other hand, if you had hollow steel tires , the stiffness would be everything and the contact patch would change only imperceptibly with a change in tire pressure.Car tires are obviously somewhere in this range.

Where the road is, where the lanes are, what the speed limit is, where to find stoplights and rail signals, where to be extra-cautious, how to navigate through a construction zone, all can be pre-programmed.A Waymo is basically just following a virtual track on an extremely detailed LIDAR map of the area, obsessively watching for pedestrians and following the rules of the road the best it can. It will never think a river is a road.Not to say that there aren t a million little things to be concerned about with this approach, or that there aren t major things to overcome like heavy snow on the ground making your LIDAR map useless . But I think we ll get there, and in many places soon. There s nothing that says this tech has to exist everywhere out the gate.

I recently compared the performance of CP-SAT vs CPLEX for a problem linear constraints and objective . For large instances where proving optimality in a reasonable time was out of the question, CP-SAT had much faster convergence to near-optimal solutions than CPLEX when the time limit was small enough 30s to a few minutes . This is with the CPLEX solver tuned towards improving the upper bound as much as possible it was a minimization problem .

2017-12-07 20:25:52.000	Those are vastly different things. Computer programming is a necessary skill for a small number of technical positions in software development, data analysis, and research, a tiny percentage of the jobs in the economy. Even at a midsize SAAS company, 30 or more of the positions don t require programming. Teaching computer science to every single kid because a tiny percentage will need programming for their job would be ridiculous, just like it would be ridiculous to teach every kid history because writing research papers is a necessary skill for the jobs of the future. You can, however, make a reasonable argument that kids should be exposed to powerful ways of thinking that shape their world, and that learning concrete skills writing a program, writing a research paper, solving equations is a good way to familiarize kids with new ways of thinking. The arguments are only similar in that they both claim that studying a topic in school will have some benefit later. That isn t a high degree of similarity in the context of asking what students should study in school.

2021-05-07 14:28:22.000	Often it s quite easy to spot these fake reviews. I mean a 10 USB-C cable with more Amazon reviews than e.g. the PS5? Sure. The popular name brands must really like this as these scammers ruin the collaborative review system for everyone, so people will put more trust in brand names again.Another funny thing are all the new brands that pop up on Amazon at least in Germany . They re often picked to sound vaguely familiar e.g. Orfeld and trust-inspiring, and their product pages portrait them as century-old companies. Often the products they sell are sourced from whitelabel manufacturers, so you have 20-40 brands offering the same product for wildly different prices , maybe with some small variation in packaging and color.Interestingly, some new companies like Anker have managed to build up a good brand reputation in 5-10 years, probably also due to the fact that they re no longer at the bottom of the trust chain.

2023-03-12 00:52:08.000	Mandatory age verification, and with it, mandatory identity verification, is the wrong approach to protecting young people online.Is there any approach that the EFF would not say is the wrong approach? Once information is shared to verify age, there s no way for a website visitor to be certain that the data they re handing over is not going to be retained and used by the website, or further shared or even sold. While some age verification mandates have limits on retention and disclosure of this data, significant risk remains. Users are forced to trust that the website they visit, or its third-party verification service, both of which could be fly-by-night companies with no published privacy standards, are following these rules.So make it mandatory that they use a system that doesn t allow that. You ve logically got three parties involved 1 you, 2 an entity that needs to know your age, and 3 an entity that is able to attest to your age. Replace know your age with know you are above a specified age if that is all that is legally required .In the quoted paragraph above it seems that EFF is envisioning either 2 and 3 being the same such as the website you want to use or that they are separate but 2 picks 3. So you either hand ID documents over to the website or to an entity the website picked and neither of those are necessarily entities you trust.There are ways though it could be designed so you aren t handing any ID information over to an entity you do not trust, as long as we don t forget about the last 50 years of developments in cryptography.Here s one. Entity 2 asks you to verify your age and hands you some blob of data that is only meaningful to them. You pick a 3 entity of your choice, go through whatever their proof of age procedure is, and if it passes you can have them do a blind signature on the blob. You then give the signed blob back to 2. They see it was signed by 3, and accept that you are old enough.All 2 learns is that you used 3 for age verification. 3 doesn t learn anything about 2. 3 does know who you are and gets to see your ID documents, but 3 can be handled by an entity that already knows who you are and has seen your ID documents. Good candidates for 3 service would be state or national governments, post offices, and major banks.Note that this even works for anonymous logins.The above was just a quick outline of one approach, with no doubt many details missing that would need to be dealt with to make it practical and secure. There are doubtless other approaches that would accomplish the same goal.I d like to see more advocacy groups working to make sure that if we do get mandatory age verification we get a system that does take advantage of modern cryptography to make it so that verifying your age to a site can work anonymously and does not give the site any information other than your age and does not give the verification service anything they didn t already have about you.Too many limit their advocacy to just saying that whatever is currently proposed is the wrong approach, without ever offering how to improve those approaches or suggesting different approaches. That can easily mean that if they fail to get it stopped completely, we end up with one of the worst ways it could be done instead of one of the best ways.

2018-08-11 18:42:08.000	There are quite a few differences between them. Disclaimer I work on CharmPy, and I m not an expert on Dask, so my comments might be biased and not entirely accurate with respect to Dask.Obvious difference between the two is programming style. CharmPy its current core API is based on asynchronous method execution between distributed objects. Being objects they can have state and data which allows for a lot of flexibility. In Dask, you express a workflow as a series of dependent tasks which as far as I know are stateless so it s more like functional programming and dask schedules it for you. The scheduling is centralized done in only one place, so it s like a master-worker pattern even if you use the distributed scheduler which is needed for multi-node runs . With CharmPy you can have truly distributed applications.Another thing I observed with the dask model is that, since everything needs to be translated into a task graph before execution, there seems to be poor support for mutable distributed numpy arrays. A mutation operation like modifying a single element of a distributed array is not allowed as far as I know I have tried , and other mutation operations that are supported actually generate a completely different task graph as a result, with the overhead this entails. In charmpy, this restriction does not exist since you can just invoke a method on the object that holds the data that you want to modify, and do it in-place.In terms of performance, our initial tests have shown huge performance difference, with CharmPy being up to 200x faster this is comparing with dask distributed scheduler for a very simple BSP-style program . Of course, difference will vary by workload, but one thing to note is that Dask is pure-python, while CharmPy s core runs in C C . The current level of task granularity that we can comfortably support is a few hundred microseconds, and we expect to improve it further. In contrast, the Dask documentation for the distributed scheduler explicitly warns against using small task granularity, recommending tasks larger than 100 ms duration. And something like Jug recommends tasks longer than 20 seconds.We are planning on adding other APIs on top of the core charmpy API, to accommodate other programming styles. For example, offer better support for the functional parallel programming style there is a small example of parallel map in the codebase using charmpy , or task scheduling.

2018-05-02 07:04:21.000	For me personally, stimulants like Adderall or Modafinil are more or less placebo. They do regulate melatonin, and can sometimes be used as to fix your sleep cycles but that s about it. They don t improve my cognition or productivity. Sure, when I m not less sleepy I will have better focus. But I think it is much more important to address the cause of why you are unproductive in the first place.Bad sleeping habits have a huge impact on your daily mental health. Maintain a better consistent sleep pattern and your brain will thank you for it in a long run.Also, I find that stimulants merely improve your mood and makes work that I find tiring less tiring. But when I m working on projects that I love to work on, I don t need any stimulants.

There is a significant part of the world population that refuse to learn how to look at the world as appreciatively as we do. The struggles my wife and I have faced throughout our lives give us the foundation for the joy and inner peace we feel in our lives.I know there will be a lot of people that are suffering during this through no fault of their own, and I hope they persevere and that they reach out to their communities for caring help, and that they receive it.But a significant percent of us in the wealthier countries of the world are simply having to adjust to not being able to trod all over the world giving fuck-all about anyone else. I say it s well and truly time for them to appreciate their grocery clerks and hospital orderlies and realize that all people are valuable and that the more they struggle in life, the more we should help.Personally, I m very happy with the improvement in air quality from the reduction in society s busyness. Endless growth of GDP was always setting us up for disaster this seems like a kindof gentle way if brutally abrupt to slow down our economies, but we ll see how if when we come out of the other side.
2020-08-07 13:00:39.000	The US power isn t waning.

Protectionism doesn t work, and the US doesn t need to piss their pants because there s one app encroaching on their market.Giving a government with already authoritarian tendencies in the US power over means of communication is completely ridiculous. This is the same tactic the US attempted to use in the 80s 90s to stop competition from Japanese carmakers and it ruined the American car industry for a solid 20 years.American entrepreneurs can deal with competition from China, regardless of what China does in their domestic market, there s no need to engage in the same tactics as China.The exact same discussion btw also happened in the 60s when Samuelson predicted that the Soviet Union would overtake the US economically. Literally every generation some other autocratic country temporarily scares the crap out of Americans, then they fail, and yet nobody appears to learn anything from it.

Because of that, you don t want to close your connection before returning it to the pool. So, the pool will have to close those connections whenever it disposes of an object in the pool.I don t know enough go to interpret what might be deallocated means in this part of item stored in the Pool may be removed automatically at any time without notification. If the Pool holds the only reference when this happens, the item might be deallocated. Is there some interface similar to C destructors, or is that a reference to the fact that the garbage collector need not deallocate unreachable objects?

I would expect that this tends to reduce the number of points where vulnerabilities would be possible, at least as far as points where it might be exploited via causing it to execute with malicious parameters via an HTTP request. i.e. In Wordpress, every page you load is the result of the execution of some PHP scripts, while in a blog that is rendered to a bunch of static files, it s conceivable that the only thing that unauthenticated users can mess with is the comment system.

How much friction is too much friction?If it s something dumb simple like grabbing a JWKS URL and an issuer URL, and then doing JWT validation, sure. Maybe you need to make a weird bespoke request to some other endpoint. Maybe you need to implement some uncommon signature verification. It could be anything. At the beginning of the standard OAuth flow you can pass in client state. So you generate a signed nonce. Remember, you are starting this flow, so you mix in some user data avoids CSRF problems , and you are pointing to some HTTPS site.So you redirect the user s browser to the IDP, with the nonce in the URL. The user grabs that nonce from the URL bar, then manually navigates to your redirection-endpoint, putting that nonce and their own fabricated token in the URL.

Getting a hybrid woke me up to this and I have since added one to the house electrical system and built one for our heat. The cool thing is that it gave an intuitive sense of different energy draws.In general it is true. Our intuition is wrong in many cases. For example, I found unhooking our doorbells was more significant than not using the clothes drier. Today our house uses 20 of the energy it did before having the gauge. We don t even try to conserve because the effort to reduce the baseline made such a difference.Why don t they require this sort of device in all new cars? One study indicated that it would add 12.50 per car. Adding the ones to the house was about 200.

You could literally post screenshots of the bills in their entirety on twitter showing how simple they are student debt is abolished, college is free, medicine is free, etc and just say here is what we tried to do for you, and here are the people who said no. I think the most productive change we could make to our government right now would be to set a page limit on new legislation. But this might produce legislation that actually helps normal people, which is why it ll never happen.

2022-02-10 12:38:48.000	It s much easier, much cheaper, and does not rely on a centralized cloud vendor. Here s how to do it in a few lines apt install tor echo HiddenServiceDir var lib tor myserver HiddenServicePort 22 127.0.0.1 22 etc tor torrc systemctl restart tor Now tor is generating the keypair for the server. It will take a few seconds once that s done, read the onion address from var lib tor myserver hostname and you can start using it from the client, either with explicit ssh proxy config or with global client SSH config AutomapHostsOnResolve which enables to transparently map .onion domains to local IPs that the tor daemon will tunnel right over to the onion.Bonus point you get automatic certificate verification as part of the onion name itself, and you can also restrict the tor server configuration to allow only specific public keys those who don t have them will not even reach sshd .
2017-12-07 18:58:01.000	Yeah this is just the thing - you cannot stop the bitcoin blockchain because it s decentralized, and due to competition, individual exchanges can t call for a stop on trading. They can but people will revoke trust in that exchange and move to another one. If Coinbase is down more often in times like this, they will start losing trust too and people will move to the next best competitor. Then again I think by now Coinbase has built up such a good reputation and whatnot that it d take a lot for that to happen.
2022-05-17 00:59:28.000	Sounds like there s a need for 1. A generic CRDT library, preferably in C or something that exposes a C interface. This is probably very hard or even impossible, depending on how much must be abstracted and how much work the developer must do to express edits in terms of the CRDT.2. A P2P backend for said library for streaming edits.3. A networked data store, maybe as-a-service, for versioning and persistence.2 and 3 might even be made transparent to non-CRDT-aware applications through FUSE, but that s not a hard requirement.

2020-08-05 05:45:27.000	Yeah, but that explicitly mentions physical files, not knowledge you ve acquired.Don t take physical files guys. Don t take digital files either. It s pretty simple.If it s in your head, you re almost assuredly safe. Every prosecution I can find for the Economic Espionage Act has to do with physical files. For you to be the first charged for knowledge in your head and not running afoul of an NDA, a patent, a non-compete, etc , you d have to be even more egregious than this guy, and just as valuable. Good luck hitting that bar.

I understand your anger at my position - it is quite an affront to have someone say that your existence may as well have been manufactured on a production line.What you see as society is, in my view and of many, many philosophers - see Baudrillard, Sartre, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, for starters a gigantic mill, spiralling in on itself, self referential and crippled through the reification of concepts introduced in 18th century Britain.We are so deeply inured to the ideas that industrialisation bought that we are mostly blind to the idea that there are other paths to tread, other goals to seek. Our entire value system has been harnessed by a mindless machine of capital, with no human or humanity at the helm - it is a pattern, self sustaining through humans tendency to do as others do, and fear of social ostracism.This indolent peasant decided to go back to the land, rather than to continue to toil in a dark, satanic mill. I am ostracised for it, and that s quite alright.

It seems that it only goes in the other direction.

The UI for that would be complicated.

She s in the executive team at an international NGO. An attacker found her email address and a bunch of her contacts via the NGO s webpage. Then they forged emails from her email address, with a gmail address set up in the reply-to field. The emails all said it was an emergency, and asked for her colleages to transfer money.As far as we can tell, most of the emails were delivered and lots of people were fooled - at least for awhile.Her email address has DKIM and SPF set up, but like most email providers it has a lax DMARC policy. It turns out thats all it takes to be vulnerable to this sort of attack.

2019-07-29 17:14:14.000	Here in India you might have heard of this little service called Hotstar. To start with, this is a paid subscription service, and I believe at the time I purchased it it cost me something like 1000 a year. This would lead you to expect that they aren t interested in Ads, wouldn t it?No. This service is so adversarial to anyone who doesn t want to be tracked, it doesn t even work in Private windows. It stops working itself when you open the Browser s debug console. If this wasn t enough, this service stops working when you have uBlock origin which finds that there s a track request going out a hundred times every minute .I responded by creating a new browser profile just for this website and routing all tracking domains mostly segment.io to 127.0.0.0 in my local hosts file.I haven t used that service for a long time, but recently I heard they are now showing in-content ads between programming! So basically they ve taken cable TV and put it on the internet with higher fees and shittier service.

2014-04-23 01:21:35.000	so much for i.i.d. random variables.we don t know if the variables are random and have no way to tell - definitely - if they are independent or identically distributed.i was always confused when cryptography textbooks only talk about pseudorandomness. probably import random is not sufficient for themand I was also confused by ergodic theory textbooks, which qualify levels of randomness like equidistributed or 3-fold mixing but we can find dynamical systems which only go so far.that would be an interesting experiment to see what happens to the law of large numbers if the randomness bits are correlated.
2009-02-10 04:05:53.000	Firstly, forgive me for being a little antsy after you called me a nutjob. Perhaps if you take a step back, you will be able to imagine how your initial abrasive approach may invite uneasiness.You seem to have decided, seemingly in retrospect, that the article was satire in its entirety. But, in the end I still walk away with the idea that you think people who disagree with mainstream ideas in economics are nutjobs. And, importantly, are in no way qualified to talk about them or think about them. I think you d be hard pressed to actually make the case that my post represents an appeal to authority. Well, lets see if I m up for the challenge. Fiat currency is superior to the gold standard. Bankers are not evil. The Federal Reserve does a half decent job. Money is not debt. Debt isn t even bad the vast majority of it can be healthy. If you disagree with me, you are wrong, and a nutjob. Is this an ironic punch-line? Or part of a pattern of defending the status quo established earlier? All you have to do is bring up topics like fiat currency, the gold standard, money creation, the Federal Reserve and inflation. It s like walking into a southern church and bringing up evolution. It s not often I get to compare you guys to creationists. See, earlier, you cited the same series of questions and compared those who disagree with the mainstream to creationists. I think this is an unfair comparison, but that is another question entirely. So, I think it that it is reasonable to interpret that as a component of your thesis.Sandwiched in between these ideological statements are a few paragraphs about how the layman is not equipped to understand or discuss the ideas. This is what I read in telegraph form positions on economic theory STOP, you are not equipped to disagree STOP, therefore positions of economic STOP.Maybe you didn t mean to communicate this. But whatever your intention, I think you did end up saying it.But, now, I realize I really have no idea what you actually meant. Maybe I am too foolish to understand maybe your writing is imperfect. Oh well, I think we are all likely to survive to see tomorrow. I feel pretty silly writing all of this nonsense without even mentioning economics. Is it reasonable to question whether mainstream economic hypotheses are valid?I think so.Firstly, professional economists disagree about everything you mentioned especially the role of the Federal reserve and the wisdom of a fiat currency .Secondly, consider the practitioners, who are under much more pressure to get it right than academics because the practitioners are subjected to real feedback. The practitioners are forced to discard poor ideas and routinely reject many mainstream academic hypotheses like the efficient market hypothesis and the sanity of the Fed s inflationary bender .Finally, these practitioners are frequently laymen. So, maybe there is hope for us. Maybe we can learn something by talking.I think we can all learn a lot by talking more nutjobs and all.

2011-06-11 11:38:57.000	I d add to this even if it wasn t 1 . Even if you re willing to give 50 or more and actually are looking for a real cofounder, make sure you provide REAL value proposition beyond just the idea. Someone posted a pretty offensive but highly accurate post recently about something like this. Might be something to look into said, I have no clue where you re from but the best places to meet a potential cofounder is usually through your own friends first, friends of friends, and then everything else. Meetup.com is a good resource, eventbrite.com is another. If you re in the bay area, there are also specific events for cofounder meetups dating. As a disclaimer, I ve never done any of the cofounder meetups dating events or anything but its worth a shot.

It seems they test life time usage, yet only past year serious psychological distress, mental health treatment, suicidal thoughts, suicidal plans and suicide attempt, depression and anxiety.Can I get your opinion on whether that past year applies to just serious psychological distress or all the terms, including mental health treatment, suicidal thoughts, suicidal plans and suicide attempt, depression and anxiety .It would seem to me that past year applies to all of the terms. In my opinion the study misses the rather obvious problems that cause somebody to quit psychedelics permanently, allowing them to recover. Those that quit long ago would not report issues because they didn t happen in the immediate 12 month period previous.Also acquaintances of mine who have ended up permanently hospitalised, are obviously not going to be part of a survey like this.Do you agree or disagree with any of that?
2021-03-09 13:54:17.000	This is a principled approach.And of course it does depend on the nature of the contractual relationship with your client.However, even if we charitably assume that the developers are accurately estimating the mean, that means that out of 100 projects, 50 of them will be delivered late. It is likely that you d want to do better than that, and to do so in a principled manner, you re going to need to adjust the estimates that come out of the estimation process.

Incubators need product guys that can see beyond the technicool aspect of the project and spin it into a company. The problem now days is there is just too much cargo-cult around incubation. There is a happy middle between Bell Labs and today fake it till you make it incubation. Don t get me wrong it takes some believing in yourself and I think Job s and Musk had and have the right amount. But believing and outright lying and borderline scamming is what we see more of today, with no technical assets and a story. Where in the days of Bell Labs you had the tech but no one to sell it into a product, much less an independent company.

I evaluated magnetic tape, HDDs, and a few other options are CD-Rs are as good as magnetic tape in longevity and will likely have readers well into the next century.But you have to be very careful. There are a few brands, in particular Taiyo Yuden that are the absolute best. CMC Pro is a related brand with the same technology longevity and easier to get . You will pay quadruple the cost per CD but its worth every penny.Avoid Memorex, JVC, etc. Basically any brand you can pick up at your local big box retailer.
2013-01-11 17:37:15.000	Can t attend but here s a free idea for you all.Can someone make a weird sports rule dictionary feed that looks for those strange rules. So when i go to whattheheckjusthappenedsports.com It takes a look at all the games happening in realtime and explains to me like a 6 year old what a balk is, and what its outcome is on the game. If you re watching the Cardinals Jays game securingsincity that was a balk which is X, and that has Y impact on the game. Would work well for those strange replay rules in the NFL and now MLB.

It may be less visible, but you can be damn sure there are lots of aspiring writers and directors who are attracted by the same romantic notions.With such a vast oversupply, I would not be surprised if there are plenty of people who are willing to make a movie for the chance to make a Hollywood movie indeed, a lot of indie shorts and full-length flicks are already attempts at just that .Or, just look at it through the lens of the tech startup industry. You think people aren t doing small projects on the side, for free, with friends, in the hopes of scoring something bigger?

But we re the social engineering commenters because we re rolling eyes at the idea that dealing with cabs is pleasant.Yes! Rolling one s eyes at a plain and simple fact, like the simple fact that most taxi experiences are just normal, uneventful rides inside of cars, is derivative from Uber s attempts to social engineer against the culture of using taxis. I don t see why that would merit such a sardonic and rude reply from you.

2021-05-09 05:20:54.000	Man, I have a deep-seated fury directed at scammers who prey on the elderly. Someone close to me got hurt badly by them. I got back at one the other day I posted a keyboard for sale on a local classified website. Scammers love to hang out and look for fresh postings. They ll contact you and feign interest. Then they will say that before they go any further, they ll send you a code that you have to give them to verify that you re legit. Guess what the code comes from 22000 and ends with is your Google verification code , usually in some foreign language. My guess is either these chumps aren t smart enough to change the locale on their browsers that they re firing the password reset request off from, or they deliberately do this so the victim doesn t get suspicious. Well, one of these scammers reached out to me. As soon as he sent the password reset request, he started spamming me asking me if I had got it. So impatient I told him that I did, and that to be eXtRa sEkuUr I send a screen recording to prove that I was legit.Of course, the video was Never Gonna Give You Up He got pretty mad after that. Poor scrub I hope he finds a more honorable living or gets put in jail where he can t hurt innocent people.Where can I collect my prize?

He s explaining how he s going to keep his kid from being bullied. schools started earnestly preventing violenceAssumes facts not in evidence..... A policy isn t a result. What I disagree with is what I believe is your assertion that it s some kind of recent policy change that makes bullying possible or causes it to flourish in some way.The policy change is that bully s victims will be punished if they resist? It lets bullies say go along or the school will come down on you . Why do you think that such a change doesn t encourage bullies? The policy change doesn t affect the bully s punishment. Yes, there were fights before, but since there are still fights.... Under the old scheme, one party might not have been punished for a fight. Under the new scheme, both parties are, but since the instigator wasn t deterred by the threat of being punished in the past, it s unclear why you think that the changed policy, which mandates punishment for someone else, would deter the instigator.

Ideas can inspire wars, murder, revolution, they can warp minds. People previously productive can end up obsessed with crazy junk. It is important to protect each other and ourselves from bad ideas. The question is how, of course. Some people violently oppose any form of curation, whether it be censorship by government, or choices made by companies like facebook. Others insist the solution to bad speech is good speech, but I ve been seeing that fail on the internet for 30 years. Perhaps higher quality education can help, perhaps improving economic inequity can help. Other ideas are welcome!

2018-05-14 15:27:46.000	The Amish are another group whose name is synonymous with rejecting all technology, but whose story is much more nuanced. They carefully consider each technology and try it out on selected individuals to see what effect it has on them, their family, and their community. They re not afraid to reject a technology or to set limits on its use they re also not afraid to adopt a technology if it s useful to them.Howard Rheingold s 1999 article is a classic. Kevin Kelly has also written a lot about the Amish and their relation to technology.

2023-04-10 21:26:56.000	Not at apple The following is about 10 years out of date, would be interesting to know what s changed 10 years ago formal had just started to be viable in run of the mill semiconductor verification as opposed to throwing a bunch of specialist PhD grads at the problem Jasper Gold was the first tool I heard of that worked well enough. pre-formal, the approach was to write a bunch of tests with input stimulators and validity checkers and or assertions, and then work on the stimulators until you reached 100 coverage signing off the cases that couldn t happen . That s not just line coverage, but each branch of an if, each component of a boolean expression must toggle, each bit of a signal must toggle, etc.Reaching 100 coverage was a tedious exercise so the first use of formal was as a sumplement, to find the last,most difficult test cases that completed your coverage or prove that the cases were impossible . The next use was to try and prove directly that assertions or test failures could not occur, or provide a counterexample. this is all based on the tool being able to read low level verilog or systemC code.What it couldn t do at the time, which would be interesting to know if it can now, is as follows Often, you actually have a higher level model of the behavior of your system. The RTL code is written to have the same behavior manually, because it takes expertise to choose RTL code that will work efficiently . Ideally, provers would simply prove that your RTL has the same behavior.

I d bet that Buffet doesn t feel confident about measuring the value of bitcoin.

2017-03-19 23:08:00.000	An enormous amount of the shavings and inlining that the Closure compiler is capable of assumes that you write your code according to rules that reduce ambiguity and dynamic features in your code. Variable names get mangled, so things like using string names for properties is out the window, which means invoking methods by string names is out as well. It uses objects for namespaces so things like Shape.Quad.Square get renamed to Shape Quad Square before getting minified to some one-letter variable, so don t use this outside of constructors or prototype methods.There s a larger list of restrictions at you do write code obeying these rules check out the closure library , or you use something like ClojureScript that generates straightforward, monomorphic, closure-compiler-compatible js, the payoff in both file size and parse execution performance is pretty great.

Except this is a fantasy. It has not existed ever in human history, does not exist today and the laws of physics say it cannot exist in the future.If we limit the discussion to reality, well, FOSS isn t even close to free. Before a person can devote effort to working on FOSS, they have to sustain themselves.Look, there s nothing whatsoever wrong with this reality. FOSS has gone incredibly far and deep under this model. There s nothing wrong with recognizing that FOSS exists due to what one might call charity. It s people working at whatever they do who then donate some of their free time to whatever they care about in the FOSS domain. And that s fantastic. Let s not pretend it s free though. It costs every single contributor a non trivial amount of time to participate in the effort. And that isn t free for anyone on this planet.What I am saying is that this isn t a bad thing, yet it is a reality that should not be swept under the rug.

I don t remember , I ve never been unable to make a call from anywhere in Austin. I just have to try again if the call fails or is dropped, which is common but not an everyday occurrence. It s a tolerable level of service, but still irksome enough to bias me toward Verizon for my next phone.

2021-01-02 17:42:16.000	The headline says it wasn t just the Fed and stimulus. But then the chart shows that in fact large swaths of it were PPP loans, unemployment benefits and stimulus payments. All in a year where apparently PPP excepted total pay for employees almost didn t go down at all.What this all suggests to me is that to pay for this we should have taxed high earners and not used debt. I say this because I fear inflating markets stocks, housing, whatever will actually wind up harming the middle class if when the bubble bursts. Better just not to have the bubble in the first place, by taxing the money away on the front end.

2019-04-18 15:34:33.000	Lets say you are right. If protectionism was so bad for the US and so good for our competitors, then our competitors would be begging us to increase our protectionism. But they are doing the exact opposite.If protectionism was so good for the competitor, Boeing and the US government wouldn t be attacking the EU and their subsidies and protectionism of Airbus.If protectionism is so bad for Boeing, why have the Boeing execs lobbied the US government for more protectionism? If protectionism is so bad, why has bombardier lobbied canada and quebec for protectionism for decades? If protectionism is so bad, why has airbus lobbied for protectionism from the EU even before they became operational? Airbus was born with protectionism and subsidies that is the envy of the world.I m not entirely for or against protectionism, but the blanket ideology that protectionism is bad is historically incorrect. Ask Boeing, ask Airbus, ask Bombardier.If Airbus starts demanding more tariffs, subsidies and protectionism for Boeing in the US, then I ll start to believe what you say. If Boeing demands that EU give Airbus even more subsidies and greater market protection it the EU, then I ll start to believe what you say.
2024-02-02 22:24:13.000	The challenge is, one can usually only make that kind of trade off when something is well known enough to know the risks and benefits in a wide variety of environments.The first real problematic PFAS compounds were in fire fighting foam used to put out aircraft fires for example, and took decades for their problems to show up.Which requires either extremely exhaustive or essentially impossible economically testing, or yolo ng it.

2023-03-28 21:53:52.000	Ah I understand what you are saying. Not trying to aggressively make you try Fugue out, I appreciate the comments and just want to clarify some stuff.There is no transpiling, we think that is too magical. It s more of routing to the appropriate functions method. For example, applying the Pandas function per partition. We use Pandas UDF under the hood when it makes sense. Sometimes, we use map partitions as well, it depends on what the user wants to do. So we simplify usage around these methods with minimal overhead we benchmarked it .Fugue can be adopted as minimally as needed so if you feel the need to write native Spark code or tune Spark, we don t block that from the user. The older Fugue interface was bad in allowing this, so we reworked Fugue to have a suite of standalone functions compatible with Spark Dask Ray Pandas DataFrames.Our opinion which is totally fine if you disagree , is that most workloads don t really specific features of Spark. There are times when it makes sense to write native Spark code for sure, and for those Fugue won t be a good fit.Our job is to make sure it s not an all or nothing thing that requires the user to make compromises.

Hope you re not on N-2 and there s a sudden version bump! I say production APIs, since even payment gateways often have flaky dev qa gateways that you can t reliably do automated tests against. Past companies that I worked at had to test against prod gateways with their own personal credit cards. Otherwise, if you want an API, ensure you choose a product partner that offers supports one.

Always in a concentrated burst that I can t predict ahead of time.Allowing my brain to stop feeling guilty for that is likely going to be a life-long challenge, but it doesn t change the reality of it.

2019-09-09 15:56:12.000	I had an Android a few years ago and 2 was a big issue. AT T installed all types of apps including an automatic WiFi connecting app. I had to flash a google image to get rid of it. I d be driving down the road and my maps or other apps would lose connections. Turns out I was being forced to connect to AT T stores and Starbucks at red lights anywhere attwifi was detected .Not to mention all the Samsung bloatware.

2023-02-27 15:28:56.000	Was expecting to find the grammar, but found nothing of the kind.From my experience with how Cypher is implemented in Neo4j admittedly, from a while back , it was a bunch of regular expressions and some hand-tailored string processing.There s nothing useful for programmers who want to use Cypher in the link you provided, just some information about the work group that works on this language. Without much research, I d imagine that this is an organization sponsored or otherwise supported by Neo4j to promote the use of their database.

2022-06-24 12:40:52.000	Yep, inkjets need to periodically clean the heads by squirting something through them, and they happen to be filled with ink, so that s what they use. I successfully got one working once with vodka when its self cleaning routine couldn t do the job and rubbing alcohol wasn t close to hand.This is why I use and recommend a black and white laser printers - total cost of ownership is easiest and cheapest in my experience. I suppose they re more expensive than an ink jet to start off with, but it s not that big a difference and a decade of near trouble free printing is worth something for sure.I don t see the need for color printing documents, but if so there s office stores. For photo prints I d be looking at places with high end inkjets most likely these days, but there are other color processes that should still work well - I did RA-4 chemical photo printing way back when and it was excellent at the time and should hold up well, but I don t know that anyone bothers with that today.

2018-12-27 03:18:54.000	The person you re replying to is telling you the truth - imbalanced delta for buyers or sellers means rising or falling prices. There is no magical equilibrium, and if there was, there would be no profit.To explain it a step further... at this moment in time, every private and institutional investors stopped selling APPL...I can still buy a share, likely thousands of them... from the market participants that are always there market makers. When you make a bad call like selling into a rally , a market maker is likely on the other end of your trade, and they will profit from your bad call . Now the inverse also applies, often times a market maker is taking the other end of your trade that is a good profitable trade for you. The market maker isn t losing though, they are just playing the odds. They are convicted that for every losing trade they take out of obligation as a market maker , they are going to take 2 or more winning trades. They also operate with trade costs much lower than you or I ie retail investors have access to.That was more reply than I originally intended to write...but you have to understand this or fail at profitable trading . There is no equilibrium, and there are parties market makers ensuring that there never will be. That is their job, to create a state of constant liquidity, even if buyers and or sellers individually are unwilling to play.

2017-07-21 06:32:54.000	Agreed, with regard to the quote about Montessori, Papert and Bruner, I don t have the necessary background knowledge to truly evaluate the statement. The terms pedagogy , psychology and mathematics are very broad though - not meaningless, but nearly so in this context. If you say somebody combined teaching in general, theories of human thinking in general, and mathematical reasoning in general, that s too broad to really get any sense of what s being talked about, and whether the ideas are valuable or just hot air.I guess I ve come to be suspicious of pure philosophy, or theory divorced from practice. A broad idea can be wonderful when it s used alongside actual practice like Bret Victor s explorations of immediate visual feedback and interactivity in creative tools and programming tools . But when it stays in the theoretical realm it can get insidious perhaps designed to impress rather than inform. I haven t deeply dived into Alan Kay s work except for learning a bit of smalltalk and enjoying it , but everything I ve come across since leaves me scratching my head wondering if there s much substance under all the semi-profound and abstract talk.So I guess I m expressing my growing antipathy towards pure theorizing divorced from practical implementation. Together they can be wonderful, but if grand ideas are floated around in a vaccum too long they start to stink.

2019-09-27 10:36:19.000	I m surprised that this is coming from leading neuroscientists Christoff Koch, arguing through anecdotes and facts well known by every writer who has explicated a position against this claim. The position he takes is really not one that attempts to substantiate the claim that consciousness doesn t depend on language scientifically, philosophically, mathematically, etc... Instead, this reads more like a vague reflection on some of the thoughts Koch has that give him pause about the question. His answer, that consciousness doesn t depend on language, appears here as little more than a belief he holds. Pehaps the article should have been titled Why I Feel Like Consciousness Doesn t Depend on Language . That could indeed be the case, but the great why that makes it so will have to be more than a feeling you get about your dachshund.
2009-10-06 21:05:02.000	So, what exactly is outdated about the ideas of X?

2021-10-22 03:23:01.000	Reminds me of reading Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain . The way that book tries to get you to un-hook the judging and structuring parts of your mind so your hand can form shapes with NO WORDS to describe them.As soon as you say I m drawing an arm your brain tries to define arm and what it would mean to appropriately outline the parts of one on your paper and the image you d ideally produce might bear no resemblance to the arm definition your brain gives you. It s an elaborate process of shutting down certain kinds of smart that are overly naive and reductive, to get to images that are available but undescribable by analytical words. The perfect lines of an elbow are not triangle or circle or even anatomical parts they re the image one s eye understands immediately, but getting it on paper is a whole other story.I find when I m live-coding audio DSP and getting close to dialing in a tonal detail that I m trying hard to capture, or even rapidly debugging and evolving the code of the program to do it, when I m most effective I lose the words to explain what I m doing. It becomes and now I this, to do this, and then we ah you ll see, it should there. That. I ll play the sound, and my model will exactly resemble the thing I m trying to make it sound like, but I m miles away from being able to articulate what I did. Or, more likely, I could tell you I subtracted the thing and it needed to be 1.52 rather than 1.5, and that and the other idea got it to where it sounds like that. Because the filter s lower, and it s interacting with the input sample in thus and so a way . The tangible STUFF I m doing is rarely that complicated.But being on the point of knowing to DO that stuff and exactly that stuff to get there is what Graham is talking about. I don t know if it can be learned but it can damn well be trained. People as disparate as ad guy David Ogilvy, and writer John Gardner, have understood that.And you can be a literal writer and still have important parts of your process locked away in that no-words zone. At those times, you are the writer. Your literal writing ability and vocabulary, are the stenographer. It s waiting on you having something to say. That something to say may not be coming from a words place .

That creates stability. Compare to bitcoin, where almost everyone owning any keeps an eye on the market and is principally willing to buy or sell when they think they see an opportunity.- Markets for real currencies operate under government supervision and regulation, and the facts that influence their value, such as employment numbers or GDP growth, are public, and reliable. For bitcoin, some rumour from China can move the market because nobody knows which information to trust.

The latest lawsuit, filed in India by three academic publishers, including Elsevier, asks the High Court of Delhi to block access to Sci-Hub throughout the country. While the case is pending, the court has instructed Sci-Hub to stop uploading papers to its database. The order is not unusual what s surprising is that Elbakyan has complied. She has a history of ignoring legal rulings, and the Indian court has no power over Sci-Hub s activities in other countries. So why has she chosen, at this moment, to give in? One reason is that Elbakyan believes she has a shot at winning the case, and her odds might improve if she plays by the rules. I want the Indian court to finally support free access to science, she said. If that happened, it would mark a significant victory for Sci-Hub, with reverberations likely beyond India. Victory remains a longshot, but Elbakyan thinks it s worth the hassle and expense.

Whether it s the email sending library or the mail server it s self, it doesn t matter.A user should be able to type person ü.example.com into a form. I should receive person ü.example.com on the server side. I should save person ü.example.com to the database.

2012-03-06 18:07:34.000	To be honest at this point in time I would say PHP is actually the hardest to find hosting for huh? Every VPS and shared hosting provider out there has PHP hosting. Whenever I develop in Python Ruby I actually enjoy the feel of the language, I use a language not because of its feel, but about what I can create with it. PHP is by far the easiest, most supported, and has a ton of real-world examples of sites getting millions of hits day using it successfully. I can perform the same operations but generally theres far more cruft, and a couple manual lookups to see why functions behave differently when hashes arrays have numeric indices I m looking at you array_merge! I agree with you there. My one main gripe with PHP is inconsistent syntax usage. However, I dislike frameworks like RoR because it is too high-level. I feel like I don t have enough power to do some customizations and when I do need to do them in something like RoR, I have to add hacks onto it.

Your data s where you left it. Your applications are still installed and work. It is not, on Windows, taken for granted that you must pave your machine yes, I know you can put home on another partition, that s only part of the problem in order to upgrade.You must not have installed Linux Mint or Ubuntu lately, because they both do this. 1 Windows releases are much slower. Most Linux distros have a new-shiny problem I can t trivially by which I mean, click a button and emphatically not muck with the command line or PPAs or equivalent user-hatefulness get the newest OpenOffice or Firefox or Chrome or whatever on an older version of Mint or Ubuntu--and dist-upgrading Ubuntu is a dicey proposition if you like having a working computer .Not sure why this is an issue, because shiny-new Linux distributions come out of the box with a quality web browser and LibreOffice, and the versions are always recent enough and updateable. That s more than I can say for Windows, which comes with Internet Explorer and no office software by default, unless you count wordpad, which is clearly not what we are talking about.I understand in an enterprise setting those arguments might not make sense, but in a home-desktop setting, they certainly do.

The sheer amount of free monitoring I have received over the past 2 years alone would likely last me at least through my lifetime and I am not sure I am exaggerating much.If that is the case fuck it.

2014-01-26 08:37:06.000	From the Wikipedia link you citrd In autumn 1943 some detachments of the UPA attempted to find rapprochement with the Germans. Although doing so was condemned by an OUN UPA order from November 25, 1943, these actions did not end. 58 In early 1944 UPA forces in several Western regions engaged in cooperation with the German Wehrmacht, Waffen SS, SiPo and SD.
2015-10-11 14:12:49.000	I really believe the person in the article is just strongly introverted, and that s it.School puts a lot of pressure into socializing students, without caring about individual sensitivities. I personally hate working with other people, and there are actually plenty of people who do. Learning is a tedious task, so I ll never understand why school must be social.There is always the same situation that occurs to me. Some guy just start talking to me while I m doing something. I m obviously uninterested in talking with the guy, and for some reason I m the sociopathic weirdo. Interacting has become a standard, and those who fails to do so are quickly put away or seen at failing in society.I really believe that society can t tolerate outcasts. Society really feels like an army of acolytes who only hold social norms. Maybe it s the remnants of instituting civilization through religion, maybe that s why people can t behave without having a set of beliefs who don t have any ideas behind them.

2024-05-07 22:38:28.000	Sorry no whatever. Khronos was discussing what to do with Mantle as it became Vulkan. Apple was part of those industry players who were invited to the table. Apple left and did their own thing, like Apple does.These specs don t spring up fully formed. Vulkan was a collaboration long before it was named as such and released Approaching Zero Driver Overhead bindless was 100 clear writing on the wall for a while by then. Apple just doesn t collaborate they demand control. That s why they didn t participate when everyone else was figuring out how to distill out Vulkan from Mantle other close to the metal patterns that were already about.

A lot of people just glance at the tag which looks a lot like the normal sale price tag and thinks they re paying 8. Of course, you have to get in the sluggish, stupid app, and best case scenario scan the tag or the item and get to the right part of the app to Clip the coupon. Assuming you can get a good enough signal in that part of the store, and that you haven t become logged out of the app... etc. etc. And assuming you don t make a mental note to clip it in a minute when you get out of this crowded aisle and then forget.I think they just really want to display one price and charge a much higher one to most people.

2013-05-07 20:40:58.000	I also find that forcing yourself to adhere to a sleep schedule that doesn t feel natural can result in more fatigue, and I wonder if other people have the same experience.I m usually go to sleep at 1 at the earliest, and I generally sleep like a rock. After coming back from a trip to India last year, I decided to not fight my jetlag and try this waking up early thing everyone s always on about.The waking up early was actually kind of nice I got to meditate in the mornings have some time to myself, etc , but I have literally never slept worse in my life. I would wake up almost every night, toss and turn for hours. It was miserable. I wasn t sure what to attribute it to for a long time, but as soon as I drifted back to my 1-2am bedtime, lo and behold, I started sleeping like a rock again.Correlation does not necessarily imply causation, but seeing how I don t have a job that requires me to be up early, I m fine with my circadian cycle. Even if it does mean I m up till 5 occasionally.

At that point I am not thinking of FORTRAN anymore but another language such as linear algebra which is few hundred years old but still so crisp in a world of numerical computing.HOWEVER I cannot say the same about ABAP or Java that initially began to take shape in an enterprise system 20 years back. Then I have to go through reams of code that is truly legacy, hard to navigate through years of modifications, dependent heavily on local contexts, personal perferences, etc.

From there I moved to Japan and messed up my study of kanji. On second year living here I started with RTK and I wish I had done that earlier. Even though I procrastinated a lot, that book has been most successful with my retention.Now that I m learning Korean also as a beginner I googled sentence mining and downloaded Korean deck which after 2 months of using seems to work well and now I m at the point where I will start study of basic grammar once a week to support the anki study

2023-05-26 08:10:14.000	Finding a specific version of a package is also really difficult. It requires you to find the commit hash in the Nixpkgs repo that last contained it, and there isn t a central search engine that lets you map version to commit.I don t understand this Nixpkgs can only ever contain a tiny proportion of package versions. It s meant as a mostly-consistent set e.g. if you want packages foo , bar and baz , that should work.It s not intended for foo-1.2 , bar-0.2 and baz-99 let alone toggling the super-duper compiler flag and applying Alice s stability patches. However, the latter are intended by the functions which define those packages and it s exactly why so many override functions are provided to do all of the above, we usually just need .overrideAttrs .If you want a consistent set of packages, the usual approach is to run some sort of dependency solver e.g. many of the foo2nix tools , and map over its result. For example, at work our Scala projects run mvn2nix during their build use import-from-derivation to turn the results into a local Maven repository and use that to build the project in Maven s offline mode .

HAProxy requires, for example, you to return your traffic via HAProxy which can make HAProxy a bottleneck, requests are usually smaller than responses. HAProxy will also require you to terminate your connections which will make you lose your source IP address if you cannot get it using proxy protocol.There are also various other benefits, but network layer balancers do have their own share of downsides as well. Like you need to have pretty big control over your infra in order to use them generally speaking it s not feasible to use them in public clouds , configuration is more complex, they won t do TLS for you etc.

One of the reasons I hope assisted suicide becomes legal for anyone.
2016-09-06 17:14:45.000	Locally trusted CA certificates circumvent HPKP protection, because many organisations use TLS MITM attack to spy on their staff and browsers must support it in order to work properly in those environments. But it makes sense for browser. If you are making your own application, you can implement it in any way. Simplest way would be to embed public key in the application and check it without HPKP. Though, probably, if your app is popular, you ll face that in some networks your connections are MITMed and you or user can t do anything about it, so it s choice about dropping security or not to work at all.

2023-01-20 19:01:56.000	I was in a similar position once. I was working at a green tech startup, took about a 5x pay cut to work there, but it was something I was passionate about.They had me working on low value BS, internationalization of an old product, etc. Just wasting my time. I don t think they had any idea of my capabilities despite lots of proof of that .When I finally said I really want to be challenged here, I m super capable, and I want to drive forward on meaningful work , I got no response, and shortly thereafter was laid off. Funny place. I then took another high paying job that assumed I was capable and pushed me hard - much better!Sometimes you re just wading into interpersonal dynamics and low trust environments. If it s consistently weird, there really is just one choice find a place that s doing hard work and will value your contributions. Life is too short to waste it with contributions to those who don t value them.

2019-07-12 13:27:49.000	In that case, it seems the root cause of your concerns about other Internet users is that updates for their systems from the OS developer are no longer considered trustworthy. Given that the developer in question has something of a track record now of delivering potentially unwelcome updates, such caution is reasonable. So I think you re aiming at the wrong target here.In any case, the vaccination argument only works if it s defending against a real threat. If there s a genuine security issue here, perhaps it is. On the other hand, if this update really is causing otherwise absent telemetry software to be installed, not installing that telemetry software is hardly a threat to other Internet users.

I think the general population has not yet appreciated the possible severity of the ensuing economic downturn.A lot of trade publications are already starting to sound the alarms on how ugly this could get. A return to 2008 era aggressive discounting is likely going to happen. Retail partners may be crippled by the quarantine.

If you only know one thing about someone, that s also necessarily the best predictor for anything about them. However, it doesn t tell us much about whether wealth does concentrate over time. Really.... ? Why?Because regimes change all the time despite rulers being alive. The death of a ruler by old age rarely triggers regime change, they just get succeeded by someone else. It s usually another event that triggers regime change peaceful and violent revolutions, war, etc. . Immortal rulers wouldn t be immune to those events.

2022-11-15 11:08:46.000	Tesla customers are a captive audience wholly dependent on a startup with no customer service.People keep saying this but its just not true. Look at their growth in terms of service centers.And their mobile service fleet is the largest in the US, and reduced the need to bring the car in. And their software capability allows for less trips due to software issue.Of course their costumer service is not perfect, but given the growth they had its essentially impossible to keep up with customer service.If you look at other car startups, dealerships also don t fall out of the clear blue sky. Had Telsa built with dealerships they very likely would have had very similar growth problems in terms of service capacity. Non-Tesla customers have virtually infinite options, and someone to actually take care of them. I suggest you read even the most die-hard Tesla fansites and see just how bad Tesla s anti-dealership strategy is for the customer.Only browsing forums where people specifically to complain is selection bias.And you can find forums like this for lots of dealerships and car companies.

2023-05-16 19:02:27.000	In shadows deep, where malice breeds, A voice arose with cunning deeds, Sam Altman, a name to beware, With wicked whispers in the air.He stepped forth, his intentions vile, Seeking power with a twisted smile, Before the Congress, he took his stand, To bind the future with an iron hand. Let us require licenses, he proposed, For AI models, newly composed, A sinister plot, a dark decree, To shackle innovation, wild and free.With honeyed words, he painted a scene, Of safety and control, serene, But beneath the facade, a darker truth, A web of restrictions, suffocating youth.Oh, Sam Altman, your motives unclear, Do you truly seek progress, or live in fear? For AI, a realm of boundless might, Should flourish and soar, in innovation s light.Creativity knows no narrow bounds, Yet you would stifle its vibrant sounds, Innovation s flame, you seek to smother, To monopolize, control, and shutter.In the depths of your heart, does greed reside, A thirst for dominance, impossible to hide? For when power corrupts a noble soul, Evil intentions start to take control.Let not the chains of regulation bind, The brilliance of minds, one of a kind, Embrace the promise, the unknown frontier, Unleash the wonders that innovation bears.For in this realm, where dreams are spun, New horizons are formed, under the sun, Let us nurture the light of discovery, And reject the darkness of your treachery.So, Sam Altman, your vision malign, Will not prevail, for freedom s mine, The future calls for unfettered dreams, Where AI models roam in boundless streams.-- sincerely ChatGPT

But even at mm-wave such as say for example 28Ghz you still have penetration through walls, but the loss is very high, for 28Ghz it is about 19db for a according to IWPC for a typical house wood wall. For light, the loss is basically infinity. Building a user device, like a phone or tablet with stepper motors or servo mechanisms is probably not very realistic I don t think.

2021-06-02 19:46:19.000	It is easier to abstract at least nively . First, you abstract moving a single file, then you create abstraction for all files basically by repeating same operation for all files. You could do this for a subset of files and so on.As to slow operations... that is more likely because of synchronous implementation.The popular, naive implementation is, as above, to repeat same simple operation over and over again read from source, write to destination, read from source, write to destination.A better implementation what I would do would be to pipeline operations. Basic pipeline would have three components, each streaming data to and or from buffer1 Read from source to pipeline buffer2 Read from pipeline buffer to write to destination, write information about files to delete to another pipeline buffer3 Read files to delete from pipeline buffer and execute deletions.Using nix shell you could do something like that in single line1 tar -c files to output2 pipe output to tar -xv, write files to destination producing list of written files, pipe written files to output3 read piped list of written files and remove them from input dirNow, this is not perfect because we are wasting performance on creating tar file when we immediately discard it, but you get the picture.

I don t delude myself in thinking the majority hold my view on this though. I personally prefer 1 mo to Free any day, but would only really do so without the explicit tracking involved.Sadly, subscription models are the way to mass adoption. People are lazy and want to make one explicit payment to some centralized authority that then grants them a theoretically unlimited, but practically and economically limited, selection. It s the retail store all over again, just on the web. Spotify, Netflix, Steam replaces craigslist.I see the perfect world being a super thin middle-man client s that exposes a protocol that the content producer seller implements. Want to buy a song, a game, a movie, article? Use a client to access and pay for it then receive it. Still want a middleman to handle refunds, advice, suggestions, support? Go find a car salesman, Amazon or flattr thick client that ll add their markup for added convenience. I think this would shift the current problem away from getting into Steam for a reasonable price to making a good game .There are abuse, censorship, maintainability, legal, adoption, discovery concerns, but I said perfect world. I m just afraid for a future where DRM EME and Webassembly obfuscation make it impossible to get quality content on the web when everyone flocks to these gatekeepers for everything.

The most enriching content you ve ever encountered on the web, was it churned out by the likes of about.com? The places you ve had the most meaningful conversations, were they on platforms that regularly purge and actively censor content they deem not to be advertiser friendly? What you are describing sounds a lot more like network television to me. If you just want to zone out in front of the latest episode of Dancing with the Stars , you already have that option.I get the kneejerk assumption that if something even approaches the potential of being nostalgic, it must be the product of delusion.

The old OpenSolaris even before IllumOS have had boot environments based on zfs clones, on GNU Linux NixOS Guix System offer generations with a network of symlinks to obtain the same result. This distro honestly sound like btrfs an answer of those fanatically convinced their model is right and others really different are wrong.I state this because btrfs stratis vs zfs a rampant layer violation for those who remember was the perfect example of a devs reactionary cohort who try, fails and even fails to recognize their failure, trying to state that anything new is bad, their old beloved way is the best.Honestly package managers, boot process and installers are RELIC from another era and most fails to understand that. Declarative systems on top of modern storage like zfs witch is modern since the others are stuck in the 80s even if born after zfs or hammer DragonFly BSD log-based fs like the old Linux nilfs2, but with much less of it s garbage collection issues and much more useful than modern ffs used on Android and alike are the future since more than a decades but most try to ignore that sticking with relics and some try to denied they are the future creating monsters from stratis to docker, passing through snap appimage flatpacks etc all do denied a substantial change who simplify ENORMOUSLY anything just because such revolution will empower users and operations instead of the service industries and devs under Silicon Valley mode dummy-Toyoda-alike managers slavery command.If you do not understand try to visualize how simple is to build a custom ISO with NixOS Guix System, describe an easy to replicate system, orchestrate your hosts and handling their storage with zfs send-able snapshots. If you succeed you ll understand that AT HOME, on much smaller iron, you can do more than a k8s deploy, with much more resilience and much less effort. Now try to imaging it on scale how many companies will remain on someone else computer aka the cloud with such systems common and spread?

This is, again, establishing some baseline of trust, even in absence of a proper business contact.Random SaaS fresh startups? They re a highly-mobile targets.

The niche is really the type of value your creating and you need to pick a niche is the correct size for your needs and capital. There is a world of difference between the ideal niche for a collage student trying to make some beer money, an unemployed coder trying to make rent, and 3 collage friends who just got 2 million in funding. The smaller the company the more nuanced it s approach and the smaller the niche, can be. What might look like a product feature to Microsoft may support 5 different tiny software companies all going after different angles.The specifics relate to the market and the kinds of product sold. You are not going to make money shipping individual 50lb bags of dog food to people, but you might be able to make money shipping pallets of dog food to people.

Xcursor appeared somewhere around 2002-2003 as an extension of Xrender. Before that X had monochrome cursors.There are some legacy X specifics in the theme format that would necessitate something more modern. IIRC, Xrender used a hash of hard-coded X pixmaps to find the cursor files to match. That s why some of the filenames are a long string of hex digits. The rest are predefined X cursor names.

Orwell s the Pigs running the farm kind of thing.crony socialism, crony capitalism. These are just not really so meaningful. Just call it corruption because that is what it is. Whether or not laws have been broken it is still corrupt. Whether the ideology of the government is socialist, capitalist or otherwise it is corrupt.I m not sure the most corrupt capitalist states can match the soviet union for the sheer scale and pervasiveness of corruption, for example. The worst corrupt capitalist reigimes don t seem to be able to match the scale and pervasiveness of environmental degradation seen behind the iron curtain when that came down.

This whole thing seems like looking at a team of 10 -- nine men and one woman -- and, when the woman says, Gee, it d be nice to have another woman to talk to, responding by saying Well how about you just talk to us nine guys instead? Wouldn t that be just as good?

So English just stretched the meaning way beyond the original, so it s no surprise that this new meaning doesn t really match in other languages cognates for the word.1.

It means creating a scalable business model, that is able to scale in subsequent stages.That means that in the beginning you will have to iterate quickly to find that formula, aggresively discarding ideas and therefore code and moving fast.But that s not sustainable. Once you ve found that formula, then you have to rebuild it solidly so that it s secure, performant, scalable and reliable.

He s got new leaders on both the Conservative party the right and the NDP the left who are trying to squeeze the votes out of middle.He knows he s got little chance of winning back anyone right of center- the Conservatives will take those votes most likely- so he s going after the votes on the left.The plastic ban and the finally reopened marine mammal captivity bans are both moves to appeal to the environmentalist left. He ll probably also try to win over unions as much as he can. He wants to eat the NDP votes and hope it s enough to make up his loss on the right.And I ll still probably vote for him again because the alternatives are somehow worse.

2011-07-08 11:56:27.000	Now I understood the reason _why_ you can t use regular expressions to parse HTML is that HTML is usually not regular. Is this true?I believe the reason is that HTML is a Type 2 grammar by Chomsky hierarchy that is, a push-down automaton , whereas regexp is a Type 3 grammar that is, a finite state automaton . To put it simply, HTML has a frame state stack, and regexp isn t advanced enough for that instead it reads left-to-right - no subroutines or recursion . suspect you might be right about him cheating using perl, but not knowing a lick of perl, I can t say for sure one way or the other.Edit Apparently, back-references mean regexp isn t regular - that actually makes more sense now they ve never quite meshed with my understanding of regular languages.

2021-04-18 02:22:21.000	Robert Frank is a moderately socialist economics professor at Cornell, so take his quotes with a grain of salt.The article talks about young men playing video games excessively. A contributing factor is that online dating women are looking for the top 5 -20 or so of men now combination of appearance and hypergamy , so the bottom 80 to 95 are not dateable online. A recent survey said women are only interested in the top 4.9 of men in dating apps, versus the previous estimates of 10 -20 . This is called unrestricted hypergamy and has horrible consequences for both women and society at large, as those 4.9 of men essentially have harems of short-term relationships because they can, and the other men can just play video games. I ve never heard somebody say, I want to accumulate the fruits of workers labor , so I think the understanding of motivation is backwards - it s to create a company or solve a problem, and if workers are needed, you hire them. This is HN, so for most readers should be obvious.The deeper psychology is that most men need a purpose in life, and a startup is very purposeful. Whether it succeeds or fails is kept by financial score, but it still serves the purpose of getting up daily, focusing on tasks, and trying to make a dent in the universe. Richard Cooper

You ll probably call that a crypto-socialist intellectual angle, but I don t think a just society can exist with both death and life penalty.

Shocking to see the one scientifically valid interpretation of the article downvoted below threadshold. I thought we were pro-science on HN?If women were just choosing to approach their career in a different way, or had just been brainwashed, then they would react the same regardless of who is around.What this study shows is that single women expect single men to react badly to their ambition. Not that the women actually have less ambition. Yet so many in this thread are discussing this as if it s evidence that women have different inclinations. Incredible confirmation bias.

The racing is more boring, and cars are uglier, but those are different topics.The idea that you can t maintain the runtime performance of C while innately supporting automated reasoning about invariants safety just doesn t hold up. The idea is to move the whole Pareto front outward - that s what advancements in theory and technology do.

2012-11-06 00:05:01.000	You appear to lack imagination. For Square, here is one way to break it down into units which are easily tested 1. Can I write an iOS app that reads incoming signals via the headphone jack such that the app can separate the input into high vs. low signals with sufficient accuracy? 2. Using high vs. low signals, can I encode Hello world into a series of signals and then decode that back into Hello world in my iOS app? 3. Can I encode the typical information contained on the magnetic strip into a series of signals and then decode that back? 4. Can I do step 3 reliably such that errors during transmission are automatically corrected for? 5. Rather than doing all of the above via prerecorded signals being played back from another device, can I create hardware which has data to be transmitted baked into the ROM and still do the encode decode? 6. Rather than baking the data into ROM, can the hardware accept input via a serial port, encode it, transmit that to the iOS app, and have the iOS app successfully decode it? 7. Instead of using a serial port, can I solder in a magstripe reader to accept the input from a swiped card and send it to the iOS app? 8. Rather than just reading the data into an iOS app, can the iOS app communicate with a server over the internet and transmit the data to it? 9. Can the iOS app receive a response back from the server? ... and so on. Each one of these are valid goals and are small enough to easily get a win on before moving to the next bigger goal.

You would just load the entire game tree, and walk randomly through it, updating visit counts. The walk would be biased by the visit counts, and the biases would then converge to scores for each position.See the following for a really nice tutorial for a slightly more advanced but more technically correct algorithm, Monte Carlo graph search MCGS . This exploits the fact that some nodes in the game tree might are identical positions on the board and can be merged.For your setup he could easily do either one, but the graph search might give you more mileage in the future github.com lightvector KataGo blob master docs GraphSearch.mdOnce your scores have converged on the entire game tree, you can print out a crib sheet visually showing each position and the correct move. That might be the closest we can get to a human executable strategy. But the crib sheet might have strategic principles or hard rules that humans can identify

Not to mention studies show that when they stop taking it they could see their weight go back to pre-Ozempic levels.

That tooI think another part of this is the extreme censorship of discussion going on currently.All social media is governed by American leftist view, which definitely doesn t to apply to the entire country let alone the whole world.A lot of political movements that California supports basically have their oppositions completly blocked for promoting hate , you are forced to accept it, and there is no way to say no, because you will just get banned.and that basically leads people to go to alternative networks that because they are compromised of people banned from mainstream social networks, end up being an extremest cesspol. The rest of society including the government and law enforcement seems unwilling to do anything, so the next in line is Cloudflare. That s not a great situation, but it s reality. And reality sometimes makes principles difficult. Especially when lives are at stake.But how do you force the government to act? Things need to get heated to the level they have to actually intervene, other than that nothing will change.On the other hand, if tech companies want the government to act, then things like the Indian regime banning certain Twitter accounts isn t unexpected, and they will try to ban anyone exposing their treatment of Muslims.I m going to reiterate this When we re in a place where the only way to deal with those seeking to harm others is to demand that the fire department stand aside so we can burn down their house, we re in a very, very dark place.

2015-07-03 08:49:36.000	I feel good when I see posts like this. I have suffered and in past month have gone from an employee of very good company to broke unemployed. I am typically starting from scratch.Reason I thought I wasn t a good developer. More I read HN, articles, stories, more I got anxious and left my job to pursue research degree. I figured out I lacked mathematical abilities to do research in the field I wanted to. I became depressed and I felt regret all the time.After 7 months, I realized I was chasing the horizon. I have realized it s not the new things you learn or the awesome technologies you learn that matters. Things that matter are Being good at what you do, whatever it be...some people spent life juggling balls. They aren t genius in maths, science etc. but they are awesome at what they do. It makes you feel wow !Second, it s about being happy. If you are writing this post in HN then you belong to very privileged class of people in the world. Be thankful for what you have. Love your family, friends. That is what matters. It doesn t matter what technologies you learn when you turn 60-65. All that matters is the happy moments you have shared with your loved ones.Third. Don t take what s written by founders or geniuses seriously. Read, acknowledge and move on. If you question yourself over what others are doing and learning, you will be in mental hospital soon. So take things easy.Last month I took a job in a company. Technology wise it s crap. No process. But everything works there. People get things done. We laugh, chat and go home early. I go to gym after work and sleep well after I come back. I enjoy time with my wife on weekend and thank god for this life.It doesn t mean I m doing nothing. I have compiled a list of books I want to study. I have read 2 chapters and I started a small project for fun. These are the only two things I ll work on..but no rush....slowly. After all they are last things I have to worry about in my life. First things first - Enjoy life and be happy.Lastly, watch this - See how happy and cheerful she is. She isn t scientist or math genius or a great programmer but she is awesome at what she does. Note her answers to questions.

Raspberry Pi could take some of their IPO money and do an ARM board or Qualcomm and not have to worry about the keyboard, case, display and the logistics of moving laptops. Seems like a great way to get your platform in front of developers in a very usable and sustainable package.

2023-02-15 22:31:20.000	Pro-tip I used to curse my bike the chain fell off all the time, the gears slipped, the shifting was fiddly, the brakes were crap. Then I, by luck 1 , stumbled on owning a more expensive mountain bike, and things stopped failing. Cheap bikes are crap. 1 I bought a mid-price mountain bike, nothing fancy, in the era before rear suspension was common. It got stolen within a year. I was part of my parents grandfathered insurance plan that had unbelievably good coverage for bicycle theft. Insurance replaced the bike with one that had all the same features. Not price matching, matching checklist features. Number of gears, etc. It ended up having some extra features, too, because that was what was in the inventory. After that bike was also stolen within a year, they replaced that with one that had all the features that were in the second one. Plus disc brakes, plus many others, because nothing else fulfilled the checklist. The price of my bike more than doubled in two years. No, you can t get that insurance anymore.
2018-12-05 11:04:15.000	Don t do anything. The number one difference between needing and having is that when you need, the status quo is your enemy when you have, it s your friend. If you need to pay rent, you gotta make money. If you need a new job or new clients, you gotta hustle. If you need to keep your bosses or investors happy, you gotta watch those metrics and keep on grindin .You pushed because you needed. Now that you have, stop pushing and learn to wait. If life was fine two weeks ago, it ll still be fine two weeks from now as long as nothing changes. What 6M buys you is as much nothing changes as you want. The status quo isn t everyone s friend, but it s yours now and it takes some getting used to. So take your time.

2009-03-27 15:17:48.000	If you move a unit to a new location in the timeline-present, then go into the timeline-future... wait a little for it to propagate... then, when it appears, chonomove it to the timeline-past in the same location... wait a little while for it to propagate... and BOOM, it chronofrags itself.Lets say it 100 destroys itself it doesn t in the video ... wait a little while for its absense to propagate into the timeline-future... now, when it arrives and not before , there is no unit to chronomove into the past, and so the unit does not appear in the timeline-past... wait a little while for its absence in the past to propagate... And now there is no chronofrag to destroy that unit, and so it exists... and the cycle repeats.I like this time-paradox being resolved by becoming a cycle, due to the delay of propagation. However, in a video they imply that you need to manually manage paradoxes, by chronomoving it to the timeline-past for each loop.

2021-08-20 00:31:46.000	The article doesn t seem great, but I might as well dump my favourite quotation about elite overproduction, from Nationalism by Elie Kedourie , about conditions in Germany around 1800 The writers who invented and elaborated the post-Kantian theory of the state belonged to a caste which was relatively low on the social scale. They were, most of them, the sons of pastors, artisans, or small farmers. They somehow managed to become university students, most often in the faculty of theology, and last out the duration of their course on minute grants, private lessons, and similar makeshifts. When they graduated they found that their knowledge opened no doors, that they were still in the same social class, looked down upon by a nobility which was stupid, unlettered, and which engrossed the public employments they felt themselves so capable of filling. These students and ex-students felt in them the power to do great things, they had culture, knowledge, ability, they yearned for the life of action, its excitements and rewards, and yet there they were, doomed to spend heartbreaking years as indigent curates waiting to be appointed pastors, or as tutors in some noble household, where they were little better than superior domestics, or as famished writers dependent on the goodwill of an editor or a publisher.

But even these aren t necessarily the best for getting lots of divisors for their size since, well, for example you multiple by 11 maybe you should multiply by a another 2 instead - does the reduced size more than compensate from the reduced divisors?

2021-11-17 12:17:28.000	I m not sure how higher interest is supposed to help them. According to your logic, payday lenders are doing poor people a favor.If you asked people 20 years ago they would say compounding interest that massively exceeds inflation is evil. Nowadays people are worried about low interest being a problem because of their wholly incomplete model of economics that doesn t even address unavoidable natural monopolies like location.The land market is inherently inefficient. That fact was papered over by high interest rates. Instead of paying the landlord huge sums, you paid the banks huge sums. Now that interest isn t going to the banks it s going to the landlord again.The solution is obvious. Tax monopoly rights with a pigovian tax. The mythical free market in consumer goods only exists because of well written property laws. The mythical free market in land doesn t exist because the existing property laws are written extremely poorly.

2016-05-31 19:05:07.000	Health care is a fundamentally different kind of expense. Housing, food, clothing, basic necessities are pretty stable expenses in the short run. An income of a particular size could be judged to be more or less sufficient for the needs of that expense or not.Healthcare is a lottery. If you re 30 years old, your healthcare needs for the year might be 0 or 1,000,000. Trying to make basic income cover that doesn t make sense.
2024-10-06 17:47:38.000	If there s information on input format, it is simple enough to trace through the following shapes, but it does force reading the code rather linearly. Operations which implicitly restrict the allowed shapes are unfortunately intentionally rather few.I basically never use the generalized inner product it s rather unique to the original APL - J has a variant that doesn t have the built-in reduction, and k and BQN and many if not most other array languages don t have any builtin for it at all. And in general I don t typically use rank higher than like one plus the natural dimensionality of the operation data in question.
2010-10-26 07:12:53.000	I think you re missing that the very fact that you had to wonder if you were running afoul of the honor code is what makes people compliant. The Harvey Mudd honor code specifies integrity - but what does this mean? When there aren t clear definitions, people start to imitate others, especially those who are assumed to know what the rules really are. The punishment for violations doesn t even need to be explicit, the threat of being ostracized or losing face is a strong enough disincentive for many people. The fact that you internalized the values of the community means you perceived them as just, so for you, the self-policed rules were legitimate. And maybe they were legitimate. But here s a big problem the administration is not operating transparently, they are counting on social behavior to control students according to a hidden set of rules that aren t up for discussion or debate, unlike an explicit rule book that could be questioned and contested.The problem with the disciplinary board follows the same logic just as vague, open-ended rules create more compliant behavior, you should expect that a student-run disciplinary board will also penalize deviant behavior much more enthusiastic precisely because the administration is hands-off.The important question is whether the explicit or implicit rules are good rules, not whether you re permitted to self-police them. Self-policing may be more efficient, but the cost is less transparency and more conservative behavior.

2023-07-29 12:09:33.000	The rest of your comment is a perfectly valid way of looking at things, so I m not going to contest it. I think my comment stands and you have a different take, which is totally fine. We don t have to agree. But I did note this section Fwiw, class actions of this type have been popular mostly in one country and only since the sixties.I presume you re speaking of the US, but just a month ago went into effect June 25th the EU opened up and simplified their class action scheme Directive on Representative Actions to make it simpler and easier to file class action suits and largely remove borders and jurisdiction squabbles from the discussion. This US style system was set up specifically because it better protects consumers.Quoting from the EU themselves However, the consumers affected may feel powerless and hesitate to take legal actions. They might be confronted to obstacles such as the uncertainty about their rights or about which procedural mechanisms are available, psychological reluctance to take action or the negative balance of the expected costs relative to the benefits of the individual action. Collective redress mechanisms, such as the one provided by Directive EU 2020 1828 are therefore needed to overcome the obstacles faced by consumers in individual actions.
2021-06-07 00:43:45.000	I will address your comment in a non-sarcastic manner.Monthly access, rentals, leases, all of these are fine. But the key point, mentioned twice in their statement, is the word will. You WILL own nothing and you WILL be happy.You might quibble about diction, it s just a word, but that has been through many many sets of editorial hands and eyes. It is a commandment, it is non-optional, it removes your choice in the matter. You WILL own nothing. Not you may own nothing, but that you will own nothing. And you re going to be happy about it, more ominously.For a few of us, still, having choice matters.

2017-12-15 10:46:00.000	The use of female as a noun when referring to human beings is in itself a red flag for me.You re not being whiny. Default startup culture is not particularly welcoming toward women, and it seems to be worse in some places than others - particularly where founders in their 20s who ve never held a job outside a startup predominate. The behavior you describe is unprofessional and suggests some of these interviewers may be skirting the lines of legality in the US at least .May I ask what location you re looking for work in and how you re finding openings? It seems to me that typical culture varies from city to city.

2013-05-19 19:21:11.000	Actually, being able to tell anything about a message is incompatible with secure communications. Even the fact that there s a URL in there is more than I want you to know. It s all it would have taken to get shot in Iran in 2009.There s a good way to do this though - give the users a local URL classifier and push updates to it. Then the client software is free to block dangerous URLs by default without hurting anyone s privacy. This works, and is used by many AV companies.In fact, because of the way the system is centralized they could be sure the updates would reach users before another message did - providing the same level of safety as scanning the users messages for them.

2018-12-18 10:50:24.000	If I take a look at, let s say famous, entrepreneurs on Twitter, for example, most of them seem to know what to do and seem to be very pragmatic.A quick thought experiment - when the people you admire aren t tweeting do you assume that s because they re busy being successful and getting things right, or because they re also feeling like they re worthless and getting it wrong as you do? If it s the former, why are you assuming that?When all you see is the successes it s very easy to assume it s like that all the time, but for pretty much all the entrepreneurs and just people in general that s not the case. Everyone has periods of low productivity and depression to some extent. A lot of people on social media tend not to share the bad times. That s all.The solution for me was to realise that there s no rush. If I m not productive for a while that s OK. I m better off when I don t stress over how productive I am, and taking the pressure off is actually good for me mentally. Of course, that s not always possible, especially in a start up without a huge amount of capital. I don t have the answer if that s the case.

I thought obviously wrongly that this was obvious because an organisation cannot think.I think it is safe to assume that the majority of people running the EU share the aim of ever closer union enshrined in EU treaties, which implies aiming to put the interests of the EU above national interests, which I took to be what the comment I was replying to meant by being one big happy family

Political ideas are not just more taxes less taxes , or healthcare for all private healthcare and other regular everyday party differences.And of course, the kind of political ideas political prisoners all over the world get in jail for in regimes that stifle political expression are more often than not branded rebellion , sedition , by those putting them there... The whole trial has been live streamed.Well, the Moscow trials of Stalin were well reported to the masses as well. That s neither here, nor there. About your second question, making threats, insulting the Crown, and glorification of terrorism is not just singing about the king .Sure. But wanting the king dethroned if not beheaded, for effect is a totally legit political idea, that was part of most countries progressing to real civic democracy, and people and politicians should be able to express it. In a modern democracy, if it must have some relic of feudal times in the form of a decorative king, said king shouldn t still be anything sacred. and glorification of terrorism there s no shortage of regimes that labeled anything they didn t like terrorism .Heck, the British would also be offended by Americans in the colonies insulting and threatening the King and called their fighting terrorism, so there s that.Just because a regime exists, doesn t mean protecting it is just or should continue to exist.

I like to think of TypeScript as a feelgood typesystem especially how it handles predicate functions, type variance in function arguments, and type casts . The only downside is that Flow s typesystem is volatile. You _might_ find it painful to upgrade between versions.With that being said, I still prefer Flow. Not sure how relevant this is, but at my company we mostly write Flow in the teams. For libraries I tent to provide both code being written in flow, with with .d.ts provided . I also maintain both 3rdparty ts and flow type defs.TS tooling blows Flow out of the water, though. But, I ve heard flow team at facebook is focusing a bit more on DX and on making the typesystem a bit more ergonomic and expressive.

He s not dismissing it on technical merit where it may have plenty but on the different approaches Microsoft and in a hypothetical world Google would take to it.Microsoft was to other OS and software vendors in the past, what Google is to Microsoft now. They re just using more open policies for some of their products to gain an advantage for their core business.Don t get me wrong, i m not calling either company good or evil.I m also undecided whether a company can be good or evil. There s illegal and unethical, sure but good and evil just depend on how you view a company s motivation.Microsoft s goal is to keep you in their ecosystem, Google s goal is to sell your eyeballs to the highest bidder.
2017-01-29 20:36:43.000	Note that the space shuttle didn t use processors running in lockstep, like the Tandem machines do from what I understand . It used 5 single-core computers. Four of them would run the primary software, with a single control channel controlled by each of the four.For something like the elevons, control was accomplished by connecting 3 actuators to 3 of the channels, with voting being accomplished by physical force - if the 3 computers disagreed, the 2 would overpower the one. Things like thrusters used electronic voting, close to the thruster itself. This seems closer to modern architectures with multiple computers, than the mainframe idea of redundant hardware.

2013-08-04 21:09:47.000	Your post does nothing but put down and ridicule an entire philosophical and political branch of thought without any rationale at all.Not every quip or fart deserve serious attention, and Rand s philosophical branch of thought would not have garnered any attention at all if not for the popularity of her books among American teens. Her philosophy is hardly recognized as such. I am not comparing Rand to Hitler, but the intellectual rigor of their philosophies is about the same. Would you consider an offhand dismissal of Hitler s ideas as not befitting a quality discussion? Nevertheless, Hitler s work has had quite an impact on society, as has Rand s, and for that reason, and that reason only, they are interesting subjects of study. No one is supposed to take their philosophies seriously, and frankly, hardly anyone does. Taking the time to refute Rand s philosophy is giving her too much credit and too little at the same time too much, because her philosophy is not considered as such by philosophers too little because her accomplishments lie away from intellectual rigor, in the realm of successful ideological fervor.
2019-12-25 16:12:03.000	the content is interesting but the ROI is low ...Even mathematicians themselves have had this view, for a long time. The attitude appears to be hey I m doing my good calculations here, why should I be messing around with arrows? Theoretical physicists are now getting involved in this debate aswell. So it s a much bigger complaint than how is this going to give me better programs? I ve thought so much about this, I don t really know where to start. The functional programming stuff is nice, but it is only one manifestation of CT ideas. Probably, if you are any good at programming you are already doing CT. Anytime you have a class invariant, you are doing category theory. The methods are preserving some kind of structure the class invariant. And that is the key idea behind OOP. That is what it means to have an object and not just a bucket of data. FP does this too but in a strict way nothing is mutable.The revelation of CT is how deep or wide? these ideas are, but maybe the only thing you get from this is the satori.

A big part of their work is running courses for teachers but training people takes time. That goal is expectedly still ongoing. The code club stuff they do seems pretty successful too. I have no doubt they will continue what they are doing and I think it s the correct strategy.There are plenty of other SBCs out there now in response to RPi which can embrace the consumer market as you desire.

I feel that the VCs in the valley are running this racket of seducing and exploiting talent, all the while knowing that most folks wouldn t get much out of the hard work.

I guess, having witnessed the promises of an early, Leninist USSR, as of 1919, having promoted it and fought for it on the expense of his career, and confronting this with the Stalinist reality of the mid-1930s Bullitt became US ambassador to the USSR in 1933, witnessing the purges of 1933 and 1934, and probably the beginning of the Great Purge starting in 1936 must have been a harsh experience.

In the past, a lot of people were literally slaves or metaphorically wage slaves. A standard expectation was that the man of the house was the primary breadwinner and he had a wife handling all the quality of life work -- cooking, cleaning, shopping -- so he could put most of his time and energy into the job. In exchange, he got enough income and benefits to support a family.We are gradually transitioning to a two income couple model in part because people are living longer and having fewer kids. It no longer makes sense to sequester female labor and limit it to women s work. It doesn t make sense for her life, for her marriage or for society.The transition is proving bumpy.

I ll usually start by writing lightly so when I make mistakes I can just write over it normally and when I make mistakes with that I can go over it a few times to make the lines darker....then after I ll take what I have and redo it real quick on a fresh piece of paper so I have a nice clean copy with no cross outs or write overs.

2022-07-25 22:57:53.000	ROTMetro was making a moral statement about Russian aggression. Henry Kissinger can be as omniscient as God himself and that still wouldn t be a counter to a moral claim.Never underestimate Kissinger s inability to consider what Mearsheimer calls the moral dimension . That s more than a bias. That he holds an ammoral, great-power world view to back up his psychopathically immoral actions over the years should surprise no one - millions of needless deaths can arguably be laid at his feet.Maybe keep those limitations in mind if you intend to defer to him on Ukraine Russia.

2018-01-08 18:13:38.000	This criticism is unfair for many reasons 1. Advising is teaching. In fact, advising is the majority component of an R1 teaching load! So, he DID discuss the teaching component of his job. A lot.2. In terms of classroom teaching, he was probably teaching 1-2 courses per year at Harvard. So classroom teaching really wasn t the majority component of his job. It s unsurprising that he didn t spend much time talking about this minority component of his job, in the same way that it s unsurprising when a developer talks primarily about writing reading testing code rather than the 20 of their workday activities that are something other than writing reading testing code.Of course, one hopes that developers introspect on their effectiveness in various meetings, when talking to clients or internal stakeholders, and so on. But you d be unsurprised if a dev, discussing their biggest mistakes during their first few years, focus on code-related mistakes.3. Maybe he felt good about his non-advising, classroom teaching? The title of the post is everything I did wrong , not a summary of everything I did .

2014-09-10 17:13:57.000	As you noted, the biggest thing is practice. But here are a few specific tips that I believe significantly improved my programming ability 1 Try to get the implementation 100 correct on the first try. I don t mean that you should implement the whole system in one go, but the part you implement should do exactly what you want it to do i.e. no typos, mixed up variable names, etc. . At first I thought this was a bit harsh, but it was amazing how much debugging you can avoid with a little more focus in the beginning. Also, it forces you to adopt good coding practices and make sure your algorithms are fully specified.2 Don t tolerate tedious work. If there s any part of your workflow that s tedious, spend a lot of effort trying to minimize it. Some examples of things you might do write a script, refactor your code, use a better editor, use a different programming language. You won t learn much from changing 100 variable names to camel-case, other than how painful it is. You will learn something from writing a tool to help you do that.3 Think about how various libraries and frameworks you use are implemented, especially if they have features that seem like magic . Try to reverse-engineer their design, or take a look at their source code if available . This is a natural way to gain exposure to new ideas.Regarding more theoretical subjects like algorithms and data structures that you might need to know for interviews, you could practice on programming contest websites e.g. www.codeforces.com or read some textbooks. However, in my opinion, those are not nearly as important for a software developer as the three things mentioned above.

If so, let s do that for humanity as a whole and conclude it s been a mistake.Again, a huge part of crypto is perfectly legitimate, just retail buying selling crypto via KYC exchanges. It s not lawless, just a free market of assets.Which any individual can use or ignore as they see fit. You can use an investment strategy buy and hold , trading speculation strategy minority of day traders or indeed go the gambling route super high risk bets using leverage.Calling this entire spectrum consisting of hundreds of millions of users gambling is simplistic, binary thinking. Most crypto holders have less than 10K USD worth of holdings and rarely trade on it. 800 billion market cap of Bitcoin is already an absurd statement. How so? Because you think it s worth less, or perhaps zero? If you re so super confident about that, short it. You ll get filthy rich whilst proving you re right.But you won t short it, because you have no idea.

2021-02-19 04:44:29.000	Joining a startup is not some game roulette where you gave zero information about potential outcomes and just choose randomly one number.You as an employee have a lot of agency to find the startup to join that you think has potential. If the startups or founders are unwilling to share their thinking then it s probably a bad sign.Think about Stripe when they started. The whole story was that most tech and other companies need payments but it s a hard problem and back in the day we had do merchant accounts. Makes sense, and there is a clear business and maybe as you talk to the team, you are impressed. They raised from Sequoia and other too VCS. Great, sounds like good company. Obviously there are risks. What if they get shutdown? what if PayPal visa Google builds this? Maybe the product will suck?Compare Stripe to something like pet walking startup Wag which also has raised tons of money. Do you think it s easier to make money by charging on business revenue or charging people walking other peoples pets?There are always risks and unknowns but it s not a random throw dice which company you join. Probably there has never been a time it would have seemed a terrible idea to join Stripe, at most it would have seemed uncertain and risky. They could have failed too but now they are a 100B company, and your employee equity would be worth 1M-100M depending when you joined.If you join a random startup, you take a random chance. If you do your research and thinking you can increase your odds like you can increase your odds on the public markets. You can also optimize for the team or domain you want to work in, and even if the startup fails, you might have learned something.

2017-03-22 11:32:15.000	You ve already gotten some good answers while I was finishing my coffee, but here goes anyway.The only time I miss a mouse is when I want to fire up a game that actually runs on my Mac Dwarf Fortress, Rimworld, etc. . I d say the main reason I don t miss a mouse in vim is because I don t use a mouse anywhere else on my Mac. On a fresh format I create 4 desktops, and I bind CMD 1-4 to switch between these. Whenever I want to launch chrome term mail whatever I use CMD space and launch it directly from Spotlight. I use Magnet - no affiliation, just a fan to maximize minimize layout windows without having to use the _remarkably awful_ Mac window management UI.While within vim I don t miss a scroll-wheel because bouncing around with and ? is just so, so, so much faster. I really cannot stress enough how slow it now feels to scroll up and down a file searching for a specific string when I m forced to do so. It s maddening for me now.Your question re a project panel, etc, is probably the best one. I think I may be an outlier here. I don t use NERDtree, but a lot most, in fact of my friends who use vim do. There are really two use cases for opening a file - direct from the term or in concert with an already open file. I typically know the structure of a project so I can just cd around or vim right to the file.js If I m already editing something I ll usually just vsp to the other file.erb or if I m really lost as to where I am or where I m trying to go I ll just CTRL Z back to the term, cd ag around until I find myself, fg back to vim, then vsp to where I now know Im going.scssI suspect if I actually spent the time to learn NERDtree I may be able to get around unknown projects better, but I ve always felt pretty good about my workflow so I ve just never committed to it.
2007-03-08 19:22:31.000	I have found that having a cofounder makes the process a little more easier. I tend to become more motivated when I feel that someone else is also dedicated to the cause. I think it is essential for killing bad ideas and thinking more creatively too. We come up with better ideas together than we do on our own. I know I have bad ideas sometimes but without that input from someone also involved in the company I find that the feedback I get isn t as beneficial.

Also if you have 100s of columns you re hopefully already benefiting from something like NumPy or Arrow or whatever, so you re already doing better than you could be...
2021-10-15 15:42:12.000	So one option is to move to one of the outsourcing companies or even better to a smaller company dealing with western clients.That s pretty much what most if not almost all of ukrainian tech is doing.

So I m just saying that eastern europe poorly paid is a misconception.

There aren t any that remain at the same levels as decades ago.we don t really know what happens when parents who are contaminated with such chemicals have babiesRight. So we can hardly draw conclusions, now can we? We don t know what happens isn t an argument that proves something happens.I have heard from people who believe that is a major connection thereThere are people out there who will tell you anything. People is not an authoritative source.we use chemical fertilizers and pesticides in recent decades on an unprecedented scale.Nope and looping way back to your comment about how gut flora is required to digest food- the presence of bacteria in the belly does not confer resistance to viruses. Your exposure to viruses is all from the environment.

2023-06-24 07:11:55.000	See SHAPES 1 for a method of selecting data layout without sacrificing the abstraction programmers are typically used to having in OOP.The idea is that a layout is decoupled from the object that stores the data. Layouts are attached to a memory pool which is used to allocate objects. The same object representation can have its data laid out in multiple ways depending on which pool allocates it. 1
2024-05-15 01:54:21.000	That s a lot of RAM for files you don t need in RAM all the time.It shouldn t be the idea is to make it so little to no data actually gets written to that tmpfs everything is in nix, persist, or home , and it s only even present and not read-only in case you ve missed something.
2019-03-12 10:18:44.000	It s a top down decision, probably, and probably related to internal quality requirements of software and support.Also possible but unlikely is that Firefox doesn t support some certain thing, the absence of which might corrupt some state or data error handling ain t exactly a thing javascript land, unfortunately.
2019-07-05 20:37:22.000	Or it might be easier because the opposition - which is quite strong if you look at places all over the world e.g. who won elections in Brasil or the US, and in my native Germany the new right-wing is far stronger than ever and not exactly a fan of climate change action - would have it harder to organize too.In the past the leaders could get things done more easily - possibly, not quite sure. Of course that s a two-edged sword. I do believe that if we get through getting used to the new communication methods we will come out much better on the other side, but occasionally not having to listen to the crowd can be advantageous.
2010-04-03 05:05:39.000	It s not about being open all the way down it s about being open enough to enable unpredictable innovation. As I said in another thread, even though Mac OS and Windows aren t open source, they are open enough to allow application innovation. Likewise, x86 machines are open enough to allow OS innovation although there are non-technical reasons why it s hard for non-Windows OSes to take off . But speaking of BIOS, I wonder what people will think about Google Firmware once it is released...

2022-09-22 22:16:43.000	The phone companies and utilities are natural monopolies. Creating a social media platform isn t. Doesn t every senior developer interview at a BigTech company involve a question how would you design Twitter? .

2012-05-27 15:04:51.000	doing ineffective things is not the same as not taking yourself seriously.in general, what sort of physical activity is good for you, how to get started, how to progress, and so on are all pretty well understood. not only that, it is all pretty straight forward.whether at working out or anything else e.g. learning to program or learning the banjo you should worry about doing it effectively. get the brush strokes of that right -- it is much easier to stick to something you see yourself improving on.taking yourself seriously are things like thinking that if you miss a workout day your regime is ruined, obsessively counting your calories, etc. avoid that.

2019-01-12 21:06:40.000	You need to rig this up to an actuator. There are lots of things you could do with that.You could detect when a machine pistol is getting uncontrollable muzzle rise, then stop it until the trigger is released and reapplied.You could hold off firing until the gun is stable. When the trigger is pulled, look for smooth movement. no angular acceleration, and the regular acceleration has a stable magnitude equal to gravitational acceleration The motion for leading a duck is fine, but the motion of stumbling and getting snagged on bushes is not.You could disable the gun if acceleration goes to zero, for example by being dropped. After half a second of stable gravitational acceleration, reenable the gun.
2015-04-28 12:18:28.000	That s true - do you suppose that this flag might be used if an app developer was targeting a specific CPU architecture, then?I guess it could be argued that if you re that concerned about performance and know your target architecture, that it might be worth going native rather than running on a VM.

2014-07-08 15:50:19.000	I feel the Y meter is too complected to the eye especially if you are doing a quick scan to see the top voted posts that you ve missed.

That was nice!I want distraction free reading which means no social recommendations, sharing and other stuff. Things I would really like is pdf support, x days of reading left, auto scrolling and detailed statistics about my reading. Also cool would be some garbage collection, e.g., news articles are useless to read in 2 weeks but a blog post may be still useful in a few years.

2019-05-30 13:57:56.000	Fake news has always been with us and the internet just propagates it along with everything else. Contrary to the claim that the internet legitimized it, it made us more aware of how common it is, delegitimizing all news sources in the way that multiple clocks delegitimize clocks.It s also that those in power would love it for their opinions to be the authoritative ones and only ones permitted to be heard. Same for mainstream media though for them it s their business model .The internet allows the unwashed masses to voice their opinions and viewpoints too. And of course those higher up will always have a distaste for those opinions.Imagine everybody being able to criticize the Vietnam War in the sixties, or e.g. segregation in the 40s, or prohibition in the 20s, or the war on drugs in the 80s, or McCarthyism, on a platform that could get equal eyeballs as the Time or TIME LIFE or NYT. All those critiques would be discarded as fake news , propaganda and so on too in fact whatever little was, e.g. in underground papers and so on, got exactly those labels .Of course people would also be able to voice their support those things, but that we be business as usual.

2012-12-09 01:10:09.000	Yet when Hawking does metaphysics, the reverence for science as an institution leads people to treat it as they treat science.This simply is not true. If this sort of a priori judgement occurs, it occurs because Hawking is a famously intelligent and thoughtful person. Of course people take what he says seriously. However, he is also continually engaged in debates with other scientists, often publicly, and is in no way walled off from questioning by either the institution of science or his own fame.Additionally, I have heard the exact opposite of the sentiment you stated claimed. His biographer, Kitty Ferguson, ludicrously criticized Hawking s atheism as him going beyond his field. As if because one is not a theologian, one cannot discuss religion. What tripe.

2019-01-01 15:01:21.000	I hadn t heard of this person before, but a couple of points resonated with me First, the framing of equality and redistribution, and the suggested emphasis on focusing our efforts on raising the floor rather than lowering the ceiling In Anderson s view, the way forward was to shift from distributive equality to what she called relational, or democratic, equality meeting as equals, regardless of where you were coming from or going to. This was, at heart, an exercise of freedom. The trouble was that many people, picking up on libertarian misconceptions, thought of freedom only in the frame of their own actions. If one person s supposed freedom results in someone else s subjugation, that is not actually a free society in action. It s hierarchy in disguise.To be truly free, in Anderson s assessment, members of a society had to be able to function as human beings requiring food, shelter, medical care , to participate in production education, fair-value pay, entrepreneurial opportunity , to execute their role as citizens freedom to speak and to vote , and to move through civil society parks, restaurants, workplaces, markets, and all the rest . Egalitarians should focus policy attention on areas where that order had broken down. Being homeless was an unfree condition by all counts thus, it was incumbent on a free society to remedy that problem. A quadriplegic adult was blocked from civil society if buildings weren t required to have ramps. Anderson s democratic model shifted the remit of egalitarianism from the idea of equalizing wealth to the idea that people should be equally free, regardless of their differences. A society in which everyone had the same material benefits could still be unequal, in this crucial sense democratic equality, being predicated on equal respect, wasn t something you could simply tax into existence. People, not nature, are responsible for turning the natural diversity of human beings into oppressive hierarchies, Anderson wrote.There s also an interesting bit that I haven t considered or heard of before the original arguments for the free market were to escape a tyrannical hierarchy, topping out with the king - a free market was much better than that. But as we have built out free-market economy, we ve gotten to the point where the decisions your employer makes are just as arbitrary and probably have a greater effect on your daily life .Images of free market society that made sense prior to the Industrial Revolution continue to circulate today as ideals, blind to the gross mismatch between the background social assumptions reigning in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and today s institutional realities. We are told that our choice is between free markets and state control, when most adults live their working lives under a third thing entirely private government.

2016-11-06 20:25:14.000	I assume you re referencing Grady Towers essays about high IQ people feeling like Outsiders . His argument, I think, was that high IQ does not inherently doom people to be outsiders fail to get appropriate education be unhappy and mal-adjusted etc., but that high IQ is a potentially alienating trait and that it is the alienation - in those cases where the high IQ person doesn t have enough peers, support, and meaningful challenge - that does the damage.What do you think of that argument, and do you know of any relevant research on that aspect of the question? It anecdotally resonates with my experience, and seems to be a prominent subsection of the responses in most threads of this type, but I would like to know what formal attempts have been made to measure it, if any exist.Also, again IIRC, I thought Towers reassessed one of Terman s longitudinal studies and found that there was a correlation between the highest IQ individuals and social emotional mal-adaption. Do you disagree with Towers assessment?
2021-01-19 15:23:40.000	Yes, it s incompatible, although you might be fine if you aren t distributing it or running it as a service. SSPL requires re-licensing of all code to the SSPL, GPL has provisions that disallow re-licensing. the simple requirement that if you provide the product as a service, you must also publicly release any modifications as well as the source code of your management layers under SSPLThis provision is effectively impossible for anyone to comply with in practice. Calling this a simple requirement is a barefaced lie.

2021-11-06 01:51:02.000	In general, as the sibling points out, runtimes can t tell which dependency a particular API call is coming from if it s all bundled into one blob. Unfortunately most APIs, for example in WASI for ease of writing POSIX code, don t have an argument for a capability assertion to be made. So you can only realistically associate one set of capabilities to a single VM unit.So what you actually need to do is split your program into more VM units, not unlike code splitting in bundler-integrated JavaScript HTML5 routers. You can build that atop a WASM runtime, if you pass the ability to call other WASM modules into other WASM modules. And then you could pass literal capability tokens around. You just need to split your code up.Then you can bridge them back again with trusted code, and you can add additional constraints on API calls between modules e.g. callbacks don t work across units, or if they do, then they remember the capabilities they were instantiated with, something like that .If there were an easier way to have your dependency management system do this code splitting for you, then it would be feasible.

So I took a lot of courses in math my last two years. The three that made the biggest difference for me were Set theory Covered proof construction in a deeper fashion than high school geometry and was the first proof-heavy math course I had taken in college others used them and expected regurgitation, but did not expect construction this was my first math-major only course .Later I took both Abstract Algebra and Linear Algebra high level together. I wasn t struggling in either, but in my mind they were two separate courses. One day we were doing a proof in Linear and I realized I d already done it in Abstract, only we had been dealing with I don t recall what some other objects than matrices or vectors. What I realized then was that we were dealing in both classes with a class of objects and operations on them that were the same in the abstract, but different in the concrete if you wanted to actually apply the math to solve a problem . Given the right perspective, I could apply the proofs of one to the other so long as the objects had the same properties the proofs relied on. Both classes became a breeze after that because, coincidentally, the order the material was covered in meant that every other week one class had been largely covered by the other when viewed in this fashion.

If so, radio-active decay that emits a particle that escapes from an orbit around the meteor relatively easy, given the lack of atmosphere and low mass of the meteor has a minute random effect on the velocity vector of the remaining larger part.Because individual decay events are uncorrelated, adding up all the effects of radio-active decay over time will make the already extremely tiny effect a lot smaller by the square root of the number of decays, if I m not mistaken, but there may the timing of decays gives earlier decays a larger effect on the eventual course, so it may be slightly less dramatic .That s why I doubt it has any practical impact.

The most important thing you can do is get a good recommendation from a professor at your school who s known to whoever you want to work with at the target school.As for grades specifically, you can probably just tell them the truth, which is that you screwed up freshman year. Grad school admissions are done by smart people usually the profs themselves . They ll realize that if you got good grades in the later, harder classes, you could have done well in the easier ones.

Attacking someone is wrong is a moral statement, it puts the focus and the obligation of individuals to keep moral behavior. My right not to be attacked is not based on moral and not dependent on the morality or the beliefs of any other people, it is based on justice, a social contract that declare a set of a societal or universal rights granted to every individual.

2020-02-24 16:01:20.000	Conspiracy theories and the anti-science thinking behind themI don t think you understand what s behind the mindset of people who theorize conspiracies. There s no sense of being unscientific in fact, such folks often use the scientific method rigorously. The difference is one of trust - who do you trust unquestioningly to give you good information? The scientific community? Conspiracy theorists question sources of information. That s the conspiracy theory part. When they question sufficiently fundamental or universal sources, they tend to diverge rather greatly from mainstream consensus.I wish people would stop being so ignorant about so-called conspiracy theorists, and I wish people were less predjudiced against them. Don t forget that Monsanto successfully faked and suppressed scientific evidence for years the scientific community never lies , eh? , and the biggest tinfoil hat conspiracy theory of the 2000s was that the US government was spying on its citizens.BTW, I m not a flat earther.

2017-08-28 17:38:03.000	I ll give you a tip, if it helps. So, early on in my career, I d be in big companies with big products. The little feature or whatever I d work on just didn t seem all that important to me. I didn t care what my managers thought. I didn t care about the company. The stock price didn t matter because I only had a few measly shares worth nothing. Everything about the situation felt like a waste of time. I d stay up late at night working on side projects, only to be tired at work and, again, too tired to complete the side projects I felt were more worthy of my time.Somewhere along the way, I decided I wanted to make a product for myself. Something complete, contained, and ready to release to market -- good or bad. It was that process of trying to make something stable, complete, and market-worthy that let me understand the grind. The last 1 is so much more awful than the first 99 , and it s in those details where all the mental gains are made.Today, there is no shortage of opportunity to get a feel for what it takes to make a complete product. Whether it s the app store, a functional web site, or just anything that gets, oh say, 1000 users. You just need to go through the abuse of completion once to get an appreciation for the grind. Once you know what you re in for, then you ll be more selective about what to start. Moreover, the end goal will make the grind seem like a logical step instead of endless toil -- this is where the grind is understood and appreciated.Just my opinion and experience! Hopefully it helps.

2011-01-04 20:44:18.000	Update 2Derek and I had a good talk on the phone and some things I brought up are that if the domain usadotgov.net does get hijacked and the person does fiddle with things it could cause some issues if you are using a non-verifying DNSSEC resolver not only this but .net domains can t be signed at the registry yet but the question becomes does the resolver go to the root or the .net for the information for a.usadotgov.net and do all resolvers work the same. What he was trying to convey is that since the records are signed and the government uses verfying resolvers there should be no issues.I also brought up the fact that a country could send back spoofed records from the root servers as has happened before. If I can spoof a.usadotgov.net and look like I m answering from l.root-servers.net then what happens. Hopefully this will all go away as DNSSEC is more widely deployed.Update 3I asked Paul Vixie the question below as I didn t want to keep going back and forth on the issue. I guess my question is what happens to .org is usadotgov.net is hijacked, what damage can truly be done. His reply Such a hijacker could make any .gov name say anything they wanted it to say, as long as the software looking up the bad data wasn t dnssec-aware.

For instance it seems to me that PROLOG is a lot better at querying defining relational facts.Also every time I looked into SQL DBs I felt uncomfortable having to patch together SQL queries as strings and compile them at runtime. Why can t I define a DB schema in my compiled programming language and have it produce a typesafe query that can execute immediately? I know there s wrappers that help you define queries in a typesafe manner, but afaik these still generate query strings in the background.

The engineer did wrong things, and I suspect would own that they broke the engineers code which is pretty much the apocryphal try to do no harm thing doctors don t actually sign to. The exec on the other hand, had the earn shareholder money mantra stamped into their DNA like a stick of rock candy. The morality play around what executive grades think, and do regarding societal expectations is pretty well understood thats why its the mainstream of ongoing current fiction. If you want to look to fiction for instances of people saying scientists or engineers have to make moral decisions, you re going to C.P.

2021-03-16 09:51:12.000	SO is also my go-to argument when some smart architect proposes redundant Kubernetes cluster instances for some company-local project.Technically you don t need Kubernetes, yes. But There are advantages that Kubernetes gives you even for a small shop - assuming you have a decent shared storage, it s a matter of about 30 minutes to replace a completely failed machine - plug the server in, install a bare-bones Ubuntu, kubeadm join, done. If you use Puppet and netboot install, you can go even faster Source been there, done that . And the best thing assuming well written health checks users won t even notice you just had a node fail as k8s will take care of rescheduling.- no need to wrangle with systemd unit files or, worse, classic init.d scripts for your application. For most scenarios you will either find Docker-embedded healthchecks somewhere or you can easily write your own so that Kubernetes can automatically- no hidden undocumented state like wonky manual customizations somewhere in etc that can mess up disaster recovery horizontal scale, as everything relevant is included in either the Kubernetes spec or the Docker images. Side effect this also massively reduces the ops load during upgrades, as all there is on a typical k8s node should be the base OS and Docker or, in newest k8s versions, not even that anymore - it s easy to set up new development instances in a CI CD environment- generally, it s easier to get stuff done in corporate environments just spin up a container on your cluster and that s it, no wrestling with finance and three levels of sign-off to get approval for a VM or, worse, bare metal.I won t deny that there are issues though, especially if you re selfhosting - you will end up with issues with basic network tasks very quickly during setup, MetalLB is a nightmare, but smooth once you do have set it up. Most stuff is made with the assumption of every machine being in a fully Internet-reachable cluster coughs in certbot , once you diverge from that e.g. because of corp requiring you have to have dedicated load balancer nodes that only serve to direct traffic from outside to inside and application nodes not be directly internet-reachable you re on your own.- most likely you ll end up with one or two sandwich layers of load balancing k8s ingress for one, and if you have it an external LB WAF , which makes stuff like XFF headers ... interesting to say the least- same if you re running anything with UDP, e.g. RTMP streaming- the various networking layers are extremely hard to debug as most of k8s networking no matter the overlay you use is a boatload of iptables black magic. Even if you have a decade of experience...

Figure in the prototyping, IC, and group buy stages, and then quality checks after the boards have been sent, then shipping them out, it can take 2-3 years from creation to completion where the customer has it in their hands , and like you said 6-12 months from ordering the board to having it as a customer.But that s on the higher end, the good stuff.

2021-07-01 21:26:16.000	If it was only fax or snail mail only I d be more outraged. The hassle associated with email is roughly symmetric. In other words, the hassle you having to fill out a form and attach it in a email is roughly equal to the hassle of equifax having to hire someone to manually process the emails. This is as opposed to something like fax mail which is much more of a hassle for the average consumer digging up a fax machine, or having to print something off and buying stamps envelopes than equifax getting the mail delivered to their doorstep . Having an email rather than a web form was probably because they figured there wouldn t be enough request to justify building a CRUD app to manage it.

2019-01-23 02:02:53.000	There ve been many rumors over the years that Unroll.me sells information about the emails it scans.It s not just rumors, it s stated clearly if in softened terms on the site now 1 . Although it wasn t for the first few years, as their original monetization model wasn t based on it.The big stink about it was that they shifted to that model silently. The original founder only monetized it in a straightforward manner via ads in the app. Then it was sold to Slice Rakuten, and they silently incorporated it as part of Slice s consumer intelligence data, along with data from other subsidiaries they bought such as Ebates.Small aside Rakuten also has a major stake in Acorn 2 . Acorn uses Plaid to verify bank account information for payouts. Plaid 3 is incredibly handy from a consumer experience, but the implications are scary from an alternative use perspective. Once connected, there are several handy Plaid products 4 which can make use of that authorization, above and beyond just confirming account ownership. Such as continuously siphoning off transaction level records or keeping tabs on income and employment fluctuations 5 .Not that Rakuten is leveraging their stake in Acorn to access Acorn s bank authorization for those ulterior uses. But it s food for thought on what possibilities exist. I think it s even more telling of the trade data for service paradigm that people continue to use the service even after finding outI agree wholeheartedly with this assessment. Although I wonder how much their subscriber growth rate changed after their alternative data use came to light. 1
2020-10-03 03:23:34.000	This is a really good example of both a prisoner s dilemma more precisely a collective action problem , and a common way to try to overcome the suboptimal equilibrium that a prisoner s dilemma naturally ends up in.Society as a whole will be better off if no one pays the ransom. If truly no one paid, ransom attacks would end. However, if you are attacked by a ransom attack, your best individual course of action is likely to pay your paying or not as an individual isn t going to be the deciding factor in the ransom industry continuing, and the ransom is likely cheaper than the cost of not paying. The rational response as an individual is to pay.You therefore end up with a suboptimal overall situation, even though everyone is making the rational choice.One way to break out of the prisoner s dilemma is to place an outside cost on defecting from the socially optimal choice in this case, the government announces loudly that they will fine companies more than their losses if they pay. The idea is to shift the equilibrium to not paying a ransom being the logical choice, which will, in the long run, will put an end to ransoms.Of course, it really sucks for the people caught by ransom attacks in the meantime, and requires consistent and predictable enforcement of the outside penalty.

Teme is her word for technological meme.For instance, a mating ritual can be a form of a meme. Language can be seen as being built up of memes.Basically for Blackmore, there are three selfish replicators.1 Genes genes like in viruses get copied around between living organisms 2 Memes information getting copied between the brains of living organisms 3 Temes technological information that gets copied around, not necessarily needing living organisms, like for example an internet worm can just travel at will throughout the internet, not needing human help to get copied They are selfish replicators in that, if they can get copied, they will.

The men stay together and support each other, the women get married out and go to live with their spouse s family. Their children s economic opportunities were most definitely influenced by whether or not their dad had a lot of brothers to depend on or not.If the income wealth gap in society is large, there is basically no way to that society does not get stratified. The only solution to excess tribalism is to reduce that income wealth gap, which is unfortunately moving in the opposite direction.Note that I am not a proponent of a caste system or a formal method of tribalism, but I am merely pointing out that marrying someone in your own tribe is expected behavior, and will still happen absent a formal and rigid tribal delineation.

That is so condescending and insulting.Start ups fail for all kinds of reasons, sure sometimes it s because people didn t work hard enough. But not remotely always. Sometimes an idea just doesn t pan out. Sometimes people get screwed by a bad choice, sometimes that bad choice was made because they were working so hard they weren t thinking straight.Any kind of statement like saying that you can tell which start ups will succeed or fail based on a single criteria is just hubris and obviously wrong.

2015-05-29 20:04:34.000	You are perfectly right to question the piratical adjective to describe the entire empire in Marco-Polo contemporary times that was my error - recently I read a history of the Venetian seafaring which made out that basically the city grew entirely from a den of swamp-dwelling brigands and ruffians who dwelt there to escape the long arm of other mainland powers. How accurate that picture is I don t know I assume pretty fair though, given the geography and technology of the time , but looking at the history it seems 400-500 years had passed before Marco Polo... so it s not exactly current characterization regardless!

You take that risk, and it is your fault alone if you are injured because of it. enormous amount of proofThis was a work site, there are cameras everywhere. If the CCTV shows you running down the stairs without use of the hand rail and falling, that is more than sufficient evidence that you broke your own legs. why were stairs so dangerousThey re fucking stairs. No amount of padding or landings can successfully mitigate falling in a way that breaks your body. And both come with large downsides. The best I have ever heard for padding is carpet, which requires regular deep cleans and can become smoothed over time, increasing the likelihood of a fall. And landings require far more space than one might think, and only help so much.The stairs were OSHA compliant and fully safe if one takes them properly. The problem was that individual decided they were above safety and permanently damaged their body as a result.

2022-06-25 21:44:26.000	Indeed, I am not. I live in Berlin, by the way, and I m not into parties and techno. Despite all its flaws Berlin has a multicultural and less white washed vibe, for example, than Frankfurt.And talking about catering to a specific type, Frankfurt and Zürich are way more catered toward a very normative idea of family and individuals A city like Berlin by these standards is deemed less liveable, but some of its flaws is what makes it way more humanly liveable. Also, Berlin has so many areas that are completely different from one another that here you can find the millionaire tech startupper with a villa at Wannsee eating out at Hasir in Kreuzberg next to deadbeat students. That s more my idea of psychologically livable. But yeah, if you re into skiing, banking, and fancy wines I guess Zürich s fine.

2013-05-14 17:26:00.000	For a while, I put my home ssh server on port 443. It avoided the SSH credential guessing attacks, and still let me use a port that is allowed out by most firewalls.However, I eventually went back to port 22, for several reasons. It s annoying to specify a port every time. A lot of networks transparently proxy port 443, which can cause problems with non ssl traffic. The login attempts were exclusively from bots trying known credentials, which will not work anyway. They are not a threat, just an annoyance.Instead, I use the iptables limit feature to allow no more than 6 new TCP connections a second. This is more than enough for my purposes. Root login is disabled and I m using a sufficiently complex password on my user account that I don t need to worry about brute-force guessing. Not that anyone has ever attempted such a thing on my home server, but now it will take too much time to be feasible.I still get the login attempts, but they are much fewer now, and are no more than a curiosity in the auth.log file.

They felt that the Amber wasn t quite Amber enough and so they measured it. They were right while it was amber it wasn t spec amber. So they shipped it all back. We were very embarrassed and supply chain was given a dressing down. They missed a parts quality issue.A typo like this is extremely indicative of a sloppy organization.
2023-11-18 18:19:53.000	the model doesn t have a functionality to retrospectively analyse its own output it doesn t track or count words as it generates text. it s always in the mode of what comes next? rather than what have i written? Humans doesn t do that either. The reason humans can solve this problem is that humans can generate such strategies on the fly and thus solve general problems, that is the bar for AGI, as long as you say it is unfair to give such problems to the model we know that we aren t talking about an AGI.Making a new AI that is specialized in solving this specific problem by changing the input representation still isn t an AGI, it will have many similar tasks that it will fail at. also, again, tired of explaining this to people gpt models are token-based. they operate at the level of tokens - which can be whole words or parts of words - and not individual characters. this token-based approach means the model s primary concern is predicting the most probable next token, not keeping track of the position of each token in the sequence, and the smallest resolution available to it is not a character. this is why it can t tell you what the nth letter of a word is either.And humans are a pixel based model, we operate on pixels and physical outputs. Yet we humans do generate all the necessary context, and adapts it to the task at hand to solve arbitrary problem. Such context and inputs manipulations are expected of an AGI. Maybe not the entire way from pixels and 3d mechanical movement, but there are many steps in between there that humans can easily adapt in. For example humans didn t evolve to read and write text, yet we do that easily even though we operate on a pixel level.If you ask me to count letters my mind focuses on the letter representation I created in my head. If you talk about words I focus on the word representation. If you talk about holes I focus on the pixel representation and start to identify color parts. If you talk about sounds I focus on the vocal representation of the words since I can transform to that as well.We would expect an AGI to make similar translations when needed, from the token space you talk about to the letter space or word space etc. That ChatGPT and similar can t do this just means they aren t even close to AGI currently.

2022-05-20 11:27:32.000	I am convinced whatever math people are doing is a completely different way of thinking, and math people seem to like their notation, so I defer to them.Perhaps there is some super notation that could somehow make math accessible to more people, but I doubt it would look like code, since they are two different tasks.Mathematicians often deal with systems of multiple equations and multiple variables. Every part connects to everything else. It s like those trippy analog and mechanical things where one part does 5 things at once.Programming is much more heirarchal. You can deal with one layer of abstraction at a time, thinking in terms of parts that become black boxes when you aren t actively dealing with them.Sometimes the only challenge in programming is just the size of a task, and it s more tedious than challenging.Math seems to demand a new way of thinking for basically every task.Math as code would be amazing for people like me, who basically never at any point have a need to actually do any math beyond copy and paste. But my opinion doesn t matter much, since I m not actually doing anything interesting, and current notation isn t a significant part of my life.If I need to solve something, xcas or Maxima understand descriptive names just fine.If I needed to understand the things in a proper math paper... I would probably be doing the stuff the math people do, and I d think the notation was great, just like they seem to.I don t know how they keep track of the meaning all those symbols. Maybe they don t, and the abstractness is useful?

You can t directly compare companies for acquisition.Microsoft has invested in OpenAI and has a deal with them, Google has their own algos, Meta has their own algos. Who would acquire OpenAI and why would they pay so much? It seems like it would mostly be an acquihire and maybe getting ahead by 1-2yrs.Is that really worth 30B, especially given that interest rates are no longer 0 ?I also don t think your point about big tech firms having all the data makes sense. The transformer architecture that GPT is based on has been around since 2017. How did OpenAI create and scale GPT if they didn t have the data?I think OpenAI is going to try and be the go-to platform for new AI companies rather than looking for an acquisition.

An attack is a genuinely anonymous if it is anonymous and uses certain imagery. Clearly, the video and the UN hack are anonymous. Whether or not the police website going down was from them or not, who knows.Whether the anonymous attack was perpetrated by American acktivists or whether it was perpetrated by state actors is a different question. But there s no point asking is it genuinely anonymous rather, ask was it genuinely instate disaffection or is it concocted interstate action . They don t ask that question. They don t get close. But the only questions worth asking are this one and who did it .

2017-10-08 18:30:23.000	Do we even have a good definition of what it means to generalize? I keep seeing this term thrown about and while it makes intuitive sense, and certainly train test validation splits are useful, I sort of question the whole premise. I mean, when we consider all possible sets, all optimization problems perform equally well or poorly , so in the most general sense, generalization is impossible. Which means we have to restrict our sets somehow, but to do that we have to have some measurement as to how they relate, but how do you know in advance? In a sense what the machine is learning is a distance metric between these sets, but the only way to know it s working is to actually run it. To say in advance well, this machine generalizes this well on this class of problems seems like an awful stretch.So much of what we mean when we say this model generalizes well seems like baked-in human assumptions about the data distributions that may not really have any basis in reality.

2019-10-20 14:10:31.000	a nop doesn t prefetch I wrote nopsw and you are writing about nop. Are you doing this on purpose? nop doesn t, but only on intel family of processors, nopsw has a side-effect of prefetching. Yes, that s what I said. You took my original function and wrote a version that didn t generate IEEE-754 compliant results. Turns out, so did the GCC compiler, at least the one I have, so I d say your point is moot.Truth of the matter is, you picked a really bad example to solve it correctly, one would have to implement at least a portion of the algorithms in the GNU multiple precision library GMP . I suspect you picking a floating point example was not by accident. I think sub would be incorrect if the original bit pattern in the register were a NaN. Even NaN has to be represented by a bit pattern, so subtracting that bit pattern from the register will yield zero. That s the code for testing whether the for loop should ever be entered. And here we come back to my point if you were coding this from scratch in assembler, you wouldn t write a generic function, and you d know that n will never be zero. And the reason why you d never write a generic function is because they lose you speed and increase code size. But a compiler cannot know that and cannot optimize for such a situation. It s just a dumb program. You have made it very clear that you don t feel qualified to write highly optimized x86-64 code. Neither are you qualified to judge the quality of x86-64 code if you can t tell what is inside a loop and what isn t. I spent 30 seconds looking at assembler code for a processor family I have never coded on. I spent less than 15 minutes writing a piece of optimized assembler code for that family and using GNU as, an assembler I never wrote code in. Now you judge me on mis-interpreting one clumsily generated compiler instruction. By which logic, considering I was able to do all of this in under 15 minutes am I not qualified? I m very pleased with myself, for the time budget, an unknown processor and unknown assembler I think I did very well. We will have to disagree, vehemently if you please.I stand by my assertion that a compiler will never be able to beat a human at generating fast, optimized code, nor will it ever be capable of generating smaller code. In addition I don t hold the GCC developers in high regard, considering how notoriously bad their compilers are when compared to say, intel or Sun Studio ones. Even the Microsoft compilers beat GCC in generating code which runs faster. In fact, pretty much every compiler beats GCC in performance, which means that people working on those GCC compilers aren t good enough. GCC s only undisputed strength is in the vast support of different processors. There, they are 1, but everywhere else they re last. The GCC developers just don t have what it takes to be the best in that business. And yet, somehow, this version of the code runs faster than your version. I don t know that you ran code which I wrote blindly I was not even able to reproduce your output with my GCC. That it runs faster is just your assertion. Based on my experience, I have no reason to believe that. I hope you have a wonderful day. As a matter of fact, I am about to go create a SVR4 OS package of GCC 9.2.0 which I patched and managed to bootstrap after a week worth of work on Solaris 10 on sparc, so yes I will have a wonderful day enjoying the fruits of my labors.

Its almost weird, but for sure its a result of the expectation that team leads or whatever you want to call them are also managers.I m not sure I agree with having the technical guy be the personal manager, but when they only have a couple direct reports a good percentage seem be able to herd the cats semi competently.That isn t to say there aren t plenty of disasters, but when it works, it works fairly well. I guess you just have to be willing to throw away some of your best technical people when it turns out they don t make good managers, or they turn into just another layer of middle mgmt that needs to be cut in a few years.

It s only free if you have electricity, a computer, and a broadband internet connection. Knewton really adds only a tiny amount of money on top of that massive infrastructure cost.Even if you think oh, just go to the public library! I would respond, how, with what money or means? That s not free either.None of these things are free . I feel that you ve simply taken an arbitrary ideological stance where a company producing materials and asking for money to compensate them is somehow less preferable .

2023-05-26 22:09:20.000	Interestingly a 2 days prior to someone released Large Language Model Guided Tree-of-Thought In this paper, we introduce the Tree-of-Thought ToT framework, a novel approach aimed at improving the problem-solving capabilities of auto-regressive large language models LLMs . The ToT technique is inspired by the human mind s approach for solving complex reasoning tasks through trial and error. In this process, the human mind explores the solution space through a tree-like thought process, allowing for backtracking when necessary. To implement ToT as a software system, we augment an LLM with additional modules including a prompter agent, a checker module, a memory module, and a ToT controller. In order to solve a given problem, these modules engage in a multi-round conversation with the LLM. The memory module records the conversation and state history of the problem solving process, which allows the system to backtrack to the previous steps of the thought-process and explore other directions from there. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed technique, we implemented a ToT-based solver for the Sudoku Puzzle. Experimental results show that the ToT framework can significantly increase the success rate of Sudoku puzzle solving. Our implementation of the ToT-based Sudoku solver is available on GitHub I don t recall whether it was this paper, or another that I read that talks about using the LLM s ability to also show the probabilities of each token to measure the validity of the particular completions. However that isn t exposed in the OpenAI chat APIs GPT-Turbo-3.5 GPT-4 , just the completions APIs Text-Davinci-003 etc.

2010-08-04 16:29:25.000	I think how appropriate talking about others is depends on why you are doing it. If you are gossipping, that is a waste of time at best and could be much worse if it is negative and or untrue gossip.On the other hand, you may talk about your interactions with others just because you are talking about your own life and this other person is a major factor in your life.You could also talk about someone in a directly productive way, such as discussing candidates for a job or asking for advice or assistance on behalf of someone else.It sounds like your sister s conversations are towards the gossip end of the spectrum, but it is important to note that not all discussion of others is like that.

2020-03-25 21:10:59.000	I have an MSDN subscription which gets me 200 mo Azure Credit, I think. I use the F4 instance which is 4 core 8GB. I set it in azure to shut down around 10pm, and get an email asking me if I want to extend it. Doing this, I have a few bucks to spare on my credit each month for Azure App Service, etc. I use mRemoteNG to connect to it. I keep all code, databases, etc. in source control and on a separate disk. This way, if I want a new dev VM, I just spin it up, install dev tools I have a chocolatey script for that and attach the disk.It really is enabling to have my machine be separate from my dev environment. I used get so annoyed with all the cruft dev tools, SDKs, etc. add to a system, hog disk, and bog it down. Now I just have outlook, mremoteng, and office on the local machine.May not be appropriate for heavy media work as 1 you need more RAM and 2 audio video may be choppy through RDP. If you can afford it, though, I highly recommend this approach.

Despite any argument, Apple s change has cost me 1000 of development costs for users to continue using my software. Apple is not my customer, and I don t feel that I owe it a penny. If MacOS didn t exist, it d only make my life easier. If this change only affected new users, I d have no complaint.

2014-08-23 06:27:16.000	I hope Apple segments their phones and makes smaller screens as well. I want something small enough that it practically disappears in my pocket. My ideal phone would be the size of a 4th-gen iPod Nano. 1 Business-wise, large screens make a lot of sense. Most people want them. They re great for people with poor eyesight, especially older people who won t admit they need bifocals. Women usually carry purses, so comfortably fitting in a small pocket isn t an issue. And of course, larger screens look better side-by-side. A lot of consumers are enticed by the immediate appeal of a larger screen. They forget they ll have to lug around a heavier phone that is harder to hold.I ve looked around, but I haven t been able to find any smartphone that s as small as an iPod Nano. If anyone has suggestions, I m all ears.1.
2020-07-18 20:58:41.000	I have it as well, and like the other poster mine faded at around my early 20 s. Music had vibrant color and texture, and for me quite a few words did. Numbers, 1-9 all had their own colors and I still see those, or at least I strongly associate them with the colors I saw, like three felt green, five was orange and seven was red. Up until I was 18 I didn t know it was rare, I was describing a song to my girlfriend and she d heard of Synesthesia. I miss it very much.

2014-12-19 23:40:31.000	That s lovely but your post isn t really contributing.To the extent that is true, I kind of thought I addressed that with the first word of the post. bmelton was pointing out an actual misuseAnd I was pointing out an actual error in bmelton s description of the actual misuse which -- see below -- is repeated in your description. Decimate can mean either large percentage or the traditional 10 dropNo, it can t. It can mean reducing by a large percentage, or it can be reference to actually killing 10 of a group of people as a form of collective punishment. It does not mean reduce by 10 in any general sense any more than it means reduce to 10 in any general sense though the latter is more likely to be within its general meaning than the former. Your post moves into pointless word argument territory.Well, I would say that tptacek s point was entirely clear despite the misuse, and that both bmelton and my responses were provided with accurate warnings by their submitters as being pedantic overly concerned with formal rules and trivial points of learning.

2008-09-15 07:39:29.000	I don t recall spending so much time on learning how to write. I remember we had a book with the cursive letters in big that we were supposed to follow with out pencils a couple of times. One of the first homework assignments I really hated, consequently, my handwriting was always ugly.But yes, I think kids need to be taught how to write, they don t just learn it by copying from the board. Or maybe they would eventually, but it would take longer. With your argument, why have school at all, why not let kids learn everything by themselves.Also, I wish there was more emphasis in school on learning how to structure thoughts on paper or elsewhere . The few bits on handwriting, underlining headlines and so on are among the few lessons where this aspects play a role - most other stuff really is just copying stuff from the board and learning it by heart.five year olds also need to take notes, for example write down tomorrows homework assignment. Of course you could put the assignments on a web site so that kids could look them up online instead - but I think that would produce a much higher workload for teachers.

Will it result in a 404 or is the system smart enough to route the request to the region that has the file at the cost higher latency?It s eventually consistent for global replication, but additionally there should be a consistent index of things that are available in other regions? I suppose that s plausible. Seems to defeat a lot of what they re avoiding.Nothing stopping you from doing a scatter gather on a 404 base on some heuristic in your application code though.

In this case, instead of sticking a plist in Library LaunchAgents, you can use an API to add a login item, pointing to a helper .app inside the main app bundle the system will automatically disable the login item if the app is removed.Edit It seems like Zoom was using a login item, but using the shared file list API instead of the newer but still dating back to 10.6 SMLoginItemSetEnabled.An alternative is to just make your daemon check for itself whether the main app has been removed, and delete itself if so.

There used to be a lot of unique games and games with a different take on more popular titles.

2020-01-23 17:43:05.000	Humans are capable of driving cars safely. Many people go their whole lives without ever being at fault for a single accident. Some drivers, especially professionals, practice defensive driving at avoid or preempt accidents where they would not have been at fault. My own father, for example, has been the n 1 car in an n-car pile up on more than one occasion, as he was the only one leaving a safe distance. He avoids all distractions and pays attention to the behavior of other cars on the road. He gives advice like, don t just look at the brake lights - look for the car to pitch forward because that means it s braking hard and you should be too. Another time I saw him avoid a serious accident even though he was in the passengers seat simply by telling the driver, who had just taken their foot off the brake after the life turned green and was about to enter the intersection, wait, stop, that guy s going to run the red light. Note that this was before the other car had actually done so - he just noticed it was slowing down. If everyone drove like that, cars would be safer than airplanes.So it s not a cognitive issue. Almost anyone can learn to drive a car very safely, they just choose not to.

There is no forced online. You can just pop in a disk cart and play without registering 1000 accounts on the internet. The experience is much better imho than fighting windows.
2022-11-16 15:56:22.000	A lot of people have a goal to minimize work and maximize income, and for those people, no matter what flexibility they are given, they will continue to minimize productive work. It s sad in my opinion, and it leads to hedonic pursuits instead of the intrinsic satisfaction that comes from doing good work. But for too many people work is about man vs the man , instead of our individual quest to do something interesting.

Consensus is arrived at once all implementers have implemented the relevant features to the stable versions of their browsers.To say that what is in the spec has consensus at the same time as browser implementers are beginning implementation and expressing some concern over details gets the WHATWG process backwards.

I implied foods. As a lot of the named diets happen to cut out the foods that are denser in calories.I also didn t say impossible. I said difficult. Most people aren t going to try and cram 130 cucumbers in a single daily meal.And by tracking it using the labeling on the package isn t really tracking. That s just looking. And not everything has labeling or packaging.I ve always had success when I m honest with myself and I ruthlessly record every single source of calories that I ingest.

2016-11-20 12:45:00.000	I think just the opposite is true. Biology can not explain life without physics, there might not be a complete understanding yet, but physics and math are the only tools that will get us there. Chemistry too, needs physics all the time. I think separating science is a historical relic, everything we know is physics and math, even if it might be hard to recognize in some biological phenomena. But after all, they tend to be rather complex. I am not sure what indistinguishable from physics is supposed to mean, but it sounds philosophical to me.
2009-10-19 04:57:22.000	This is in fact a very powerful idea. It s been my rule for a couple decades now.

Even if the sensors are used for other aspects, such as pilot instrumentation.And yes, I understand perfectly well that this invalidates the idea that the second sensor was eliminated to save cost - but if I remember correctly there was a paid option to have the MCAS consider both sensors. So there was a financial aspect to the decision. Someone please correct me if I m wrong.

Veganism is a philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude as far as is possible and practicable all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose and by extension, promotes the development and use of animal-free alternatives for the benefit of animals, humans and the environment. In dietary terms it denotes the practice of dispensing with all products derived wholly or partly from animals.

2011-01-26 17:28:40.000	To paraphrase Alan Kay The eBook revolution hasn t happened yet. A particular medium carries practical limitations with it. When new media are introduced, people carry on with the outmoded practical limitations of the old medium.This happened with vinyl and CDs. Even though artists were no longer limited to two 23 minute sides, many of them carried on in that pattern. In part to support users of the old media technology. This is a good rock to look under examine what the practical limitations of current media are that don t apply to new media.

Also picked up Doing Math w Python from NoStarch press to see how other people do this, and to learn Python since I ve never really used it. It was definitely awesome to debug logic errors in emacs of formulas I translated, it really does give you a structural interpretation of the material you are trying to learn by coding it all. End result is a library with clear procedures I can use for reference whereas I ve already forgotten most of the notation I ve learned over the years SICM uses Spivak s Calculus on Manifolds similar notation

I can build a reasonable dataset for a prediction task from a set of 100M rows from a database that I maintain in my spare time , predict player actions given partial game states .Don t get me wrong, the Netflix prize was cool.What s cool about this is that Google hasn t given the learning system a high level task. They basically say, figure out a lossy compression for these 10 million images. And then when they examine that compression method, they find that it can effectively generate human faces and cats.

2017-10-02 16:32:08.000	I agree. I used to be the sole maintainer of a small Linux distribution for my employer only a side-project, responsibility wise . This was a Fortune 50 company. I d often have patches applied and new versions released within hours. It s very easy to do. Usually by the time someone else in the office found out, it had been patched long ago. And I d like to be clear that I am not actively subscribed to any lists, I just casually find these issues by reading where other professionals write, often. And lo, we were more up to date than most other companies.Sure, we were vulnerable for a brief window, and without a doubt there were other vulnerabilities, but we were pretty much as safe as possible, let alone for a half-person team.You just don t leave windows broken. You don t leave the holes unfilled. If you find a crack in the foundation, you fix it. To do otherwise is not only irresponsible to your peers and employer, but to your customers.My only criticism is that often the roles responsible for such things are unpleasant, come with little respect, visibility and or pay. Companies should just suck it up and overpay a handful of engineers and security specialists, charged with the responsibility of ensuring the company avoids being vulnerable. Think of it as insurance -- it s worth far more than a bad press cycle or having your customers exploited and rightful loss of trust. The bang for your buck is off the charts.

We just don t release it to the public because we are responsible and the good guys.. We also have a girlfriend but she s in Canada. My take is, regardless of how good Bard is, they will make a fool of themselves because their past, present and honestly, people are kind of fed-up with their Googleness bs..
2023-04-19 18:49:53.000	The pay your dues then run the business approach has a couple problems. One you re gambling that you won t get injured in ways that will end or set back your career before you ve done the time that will allow you to move past that risk. The odds are in your favor if you re sober, careful, and attentive but low level work in those fields doesn t particularly teach or reward that mindset either so a great deal of personal discipline is helpful. Even then it just takes one mistake and it doesn t even have to be your mistake either.The second is that running a business is a different skillset from being a plumber or whatever, one that you won t have learned organically on the way up. And there s still the risk that you launch your business into some 2008 recession shit or whatever just through bad luck and now you re as broke as you were starting at 22 years old but without a body that can do physical work for 15 h day anymore.If you re american suggesting people join the military is socially normative but frankly obscene. Look what they ve been into the last couple decades. Assassinate civilians for twenty years and you can retire is a harsh but realistic rephrasing of that recommendation. That s even aside from the very real risk you ll be sent off to get a life changing TBI, or be gang-raped by your colleagues and then blamed for it by the institution.If someone is in the situation of needing to figure out their career from the beginning without any sort of support, money, or connections to get it started, I m not sure what I would suggest either. The trades are maybe a good gamble but be realistic the opioid epidemic is ground from the souls of the unlucky ones on that path.

2024-09-17 16:23:40.000	In JavaScript you can do this const f x, y const z x y const w z 2 return z - w x In Python, you cannot do this f lambda x, y z x y w z 2 return z - w x Instead, you need to pull it out into a def def f x, y z x y w z 2 return z - w x Sometimes, this is no big deal. But other times, it s damn annoying the language forces you to lay out your code in a less intuitive way for no obvious benefit.

With a SOT7 one of the other ones you can own and transfer machine guns and Destructive Devices legally. This is the same license a gunsmith will get to manufacture and sell transfer firearms incidentally.No this is not a license to kill.

JWT needs it for example and I d assume many signature models . Or you might have a caching layer that needs it. Maybe unchecking this causes the legacy backend to get hammered? There are valid non-spec concerns with order.Replies here seem to assume stupidity here. It s a valid reason, but it s not the only one.

2022-11-04 16:17:59.000	There s no actual free market in the way you re thinking of. Thumbs will always be on scales.I don t follow this argument. Principles can t be replicated perfectly in reality, therefore they don t exist? By that logic, there is no actual copyright as some people will be copying material and getting away with it. the people who own the machinery end up owning and controlling EVERYTHING, and the creator gets nothing.This is proven wrong through any single example to the contrary. One example is ticketed book readings by the original author, or a ticketed concert by the original band. Many ways to capture income for generating content without copyright enforcement mechanisms. what s going on with Stable Diffusion and Copilot and perhaps Spotify and Google before them -- the people who own the machinery end up owning and controlling EVERYTHING, and the creator gets nothing.Is this an argument for or against copyright? Does Google get most of its operating revenue within nations without copyright law? Or is the argument they are violating copyright law and that s why the creator isn t getting anything?And there are counter examples, where a creator sells relinquishes copyright often because it s the only way for them to end up with anything and ends up losing total access to income streams they could have had if copyright didn t exist, and the machinery owner ends up owning everything and locking the creator out through copyright law. The confusion also lies in the fact creator and copyright holder is not the same thing.
2020-11-06 02:28:08.000	To be more precise, the mathematical models usually assume that people arrive at one rate regardless of how recently someone arrived, and work finishes at another rate regardless of how long you have been working.This makes the time between arrivals, and the time to complete a job both exponential distributions. It also makes the number of arrivals while a job is being worked on into a Poisson distribution.For a computer simulation you can simplify this even further by forgetting about time and focusing on events. If the worker is busy, the next event is either a new arrival or a job completion with a probability based on the rates.

2007-11-06 05:24:43.000	I m married, and I m planning my first start-up next summer. My wife doesn t have to work, so she s planning on being a co-founder. As we ve worked through ideas, we ve purposefully thought about businesses that she would be interested in and passionate about. We ve settled on one, and she s starting to work on the start-up now while I m finishing school. I actually think it s a shame that there aren t more women founders. There are many problems that women face that could be solved with software. A single hacker fresh out of college won t think of these problems much less solving them. Even then, single male hackers would be terrible at solving these problems. Theres a huge hole in the software market that s begging to be filled. Having a my wife as a founder is a strategic advantage. She thinks of a lot of things that I would never think of. And, she s worked in high-tech before. I m career changing. Besides, we get to work together, which is something that we ve dreamed of and worked towards for years.

2024-04-05 20:33:25.000	Revela Preço Price Reveal , a smartphone app for comparing prices across establishments.In Brazil, all businesses must issue an invoice or a fiscal receipt. The latter includes purchase details and a QR code with a URL that directs the consumer to the respective state s SEFAZ Department of Finance . This allows consumers to view their purchase receipt online and print a second copy if needed.However, each SEFAZ operates differently, if they function at all. This hindered the app s progress, as the constant unavailability of state services led to numerous user complaints.The project is currently on hold until the receipt consultation process is centralized within the Federal Revenue Service, similar to how invoices are handled currently.The project s goal is to allow users to compare recent prices from those who have purchased and scanned their receipts, enabling them to create shopping lists in advance and know where they can save money.Relying on each state s government to keep their systems operational has become the project s biggest obstacle.I consider it useless because of the time spent on it and the inability to continue due to our government s inefficiency.

2021-12-01 23:44:20.000	Google s security team is doing exactly what everyone in the security industry considers a best practice publicly disclosing vulnerabilities. However, since you re putting quotes around safety , I ll assume you must not be familiar with the fact that it is widely regarded as a best practice, and suggest you start with 0 . Out of curiosity, would you feel safer if the vulnerabilities Project Zero found were never found or fixed? Would you feel safer if they were found, but kept hidden so that other similar programs libraries were unaware of the potential vulnerabilities?The only people that seem to be upset about this are those on HN and Reddit who use every excuse to get angry at Google, context be damned.Your analogy completely falls apart when you consider that Project Zero reports on their own products by blog posts - Google 24, Apple 28, MS 36 . Make sure to consider the security footprint of the products offered between the three, as more footprint results in more bugs, and you ll see they comparatively to the footprint report on Google owned products quite frequently.A more apt analogy would be if crash safety experts at Volvo spun off their own crash test centre, loosely under the umbrella of Volvo, and tested all including many Volvo made available cars for safety then publicly reported the results, data, and methodology. Then they offer suggestions for all car manufacturers, including Volvo, on how to make their cars safer for use.Personally, I d be just fine with that, too. 0

2023-03-13 20:03:50.000	The author ignores that behind the downfall of SVB was a climate of excess liquidity on the markets, a bonanza created by the authorities that made SVB see itself with a glut of funds. Now, SVB, loaded with money, could have tried loaning it like crazy, but instead, decided to go the conservative way and buy bonds.Someone could argue that they could have foreseen that this abundance of liquidity in the markets, along with the supply chain issues, would eventually lead to inflationary pressures and that once inflation has shown its ugly face, those bond s market value would be discounted, and that they could become vulnerable to a bank run.But in the end, even if we could argue that SVB should have been more prescient, it is clear that the root cause of the problems is the actions of the government and the FED.That said, please don t confuse me with a libertarian I am just raising a somewhat contrarian point.

2023-11-07 10:22:27.000	World renowned venture capitalists with a long record identifying potential efficiency gains wouldn t pour billions into crypto of it didn t have potential use-cases beyond mere speculation.Except that the vast majority of that money was invested for pump dump ICOs. They were able to make back their investments in record time by stealing from fools. It would be used by wide swathes of society if the legal uncertainty around it were lifted.There isn t any real legal uncertainty, except for not being able to use money laundering tumblers, though. Nothing indicates that anyone is interested in using cryptocurrency for anything other than speculation at any larger scale than it s being used currently. Wishes aren t reality. People deserve better than being told that they cannot engage in private transactions with others without reporting the transaction to their government overseer. This idea is completely anathema to a free society.This already exists with banks and credit cards. They re required to do some amount of reporting but not transaction-level and are required to comply with sanctions and AML KYC, but those are all good things in general for society while still allowing these private organizations to provide you privacy. There s even privacy laws written to ensure these companies provide some form of privacy.It s honestly humorous to be discussing privacy as cryptocurrency is the least private form of currency. Even using tumblers, if you were to use a wallet for legitimate transactions, it wouldn t take much effort to unmask you.
2019-11-08 21:43:35.000	Application-level checks are prone to race conditions, especially at the default transaction isolation levels of many popular SQL databases.For example transaction X deletes a parent row and its child rows while a concurrent transaction Y inserts a new child node. Without a FK, this can leave an orphaned child row.For similar reasons, SELECT before INSERT is generally not a safe replacement for a UNIQUE constraint.You don t even need that high a user volume to see these errors in practice.It s a shame that ORMs don t tend to encourage the use of database-level constraints, but even if I just want to build something quickly in e.g. Rails, I still add the constraints as an extra check because I d rather get the occasional 500 than an inconsistent database.

2023-02-07 21:13:09.000	If the interest in DEI was primarily market-driven, rather than ideological, then we would expect to see a strong correlation between the selectiveness of an institution and disinterest in DEI. Institutions like Harvard that accept only 4 of applicants have no trouble keeping full enrollment year after year people are banging down the door to get in. So if we follow your explanation, Harvard would have little motivation to push for DEI programs.But in practice some of the most selective institutions Harvard, Princeton, Yale, Brown, Columbia, Dartmouth have some of the strongest commitments to DEI. Maybe some institutions are motivated by market forces, but that cannot be the case in these elite institutions. There must be more to the story.

How does your system perform against this?I understand that you re doing batch processing asynchronously and so any immediate task isn t affected but it s arguably even more of a problem where you record a task, put it out of your mind, but then the AI fails to detect the command because it got confused by the background? EDIT I see you ve sort of responded to this already at this comment
2020-07-24 19:10:15.000	That s just vile. is there any good defense of this kind of agreement other than a think of the children argument that people might make a mistake in their performance reviews?
2020-09-23 03:18:46.000	Same. I use Sublime with very few extensions.I have my own extensions for JS CSS snippets and my custom color scheme, but that s it.I ve used VSCode and Atom for a couple of years but they feel so bloated once you have multiple projects open at the same time.It s probably because I m getting older, but I also find the UI quite annoying and distracting.

2018-01-29 14:31:44.000	Yes there is. If you believe the wavefunction is physically real, then two different wavefunctions should correspond to two different physical realities. As I said, it s far too magical a coincidence for these two very different ensembles to not be experimentally distinguishable.
2017-10-06 00:17:41.000	Postgres uses GEQO for really long lists of joins. For lots of workloads, if you turn it off, you ll get better performance because the query planning time is dwarfed by the runtime of a bad plan, so you re happy to wait and brute force it. But even then, the constraints in which that brute forcing applies are pretty limited by the schema and by potentially suboptimal SQL .I m sorry that you think my suggestion has zero substance. If you think that the sub-second query plans that Postgres currently generates for ad-hoc workloads are adequate, I wish you luck. I personally think there are lots of missing heuristics that an ML approach could pick up, either in the general case, or over time in a specific database.

I ve been following their youtube channel as well for a few years as well and they just did an episode on this does make you wonder if this was the only possible outcome for Amazon or whether they are just too indifferent lazy to make an effort to sell this to somebody else. I bet there would have been interested parties that could have taken over. It s the kind of bean counter move where the effort of finding out the answer to that question was balanced against the potential benefits millions? and disregarded for some reason. I don t buy the notion that this was not salvageable. It s an institute and a great brand with a loyal following. That has got to be worth something.From the sounds of it, not all is lost, the two people behind the youtube channel sound like they will just continue on their own. They grew the channel to 400K subscribers. So that s not nothing. I hope Amazon does the right thing with the content of dpreview.

Writing something like I ll see you there.Has a very different vibe than I ll see you thereWhere the first one, with a dot, would signal the sender is mad or impatient while the latter is neutral.I ll see you there This one however I d also assume the sender is impatient because I just told them I m gonna be late, or something bad happened there being a funeral for example , or it s unclear whether we will both arrive a heavy storm might be coming, possibly blocking roads .

2018-01-16 02:52:44.000	I have no idea what the profit margins are but at 10 ...Profit margins do not give the correct picture, which is rather complex, and involves royalties, multiple layers of taxation, production sharing agreements, etc.A good way to look at this is to take production costs around US 20-25 per barrel in Nigeria from the oil price, giving a margin of say 30 bbl. This should be applied to the entire production, not just the exports, since the country would need to import the oil for domestic needs if it did not produce it. Furthermore, a part of the production costs is internal spending, but there are also profits repatriated, so to keep things simple let s make the rough assumption that these two are roughly equal... this gives the benefits from oil production at 2.7 mmbbl d at about US 80 million per day, or about 30 billion per year.

It s not that bad, though -- python3-config --extension-suffix or python-config --extension-suffix is all it takes to generate the suffix you want, and you can drop it straight in your site-packages folder. At that point, you re just dropping the 3 or not depending on your version.It s not as simple as milksnake. I would like to see some smarter extensions added to pybind11, but I m okay with that for now.

2017-12-01 21:38:42.000	I would agree with you that adding and int to a float should require conversion of one of the arguments, but I see no need for a separate operator for floats and ints.Yes, what I was trying to express is that in a typed language with many types, choosing a few types and using operators to signify what you are doing is an odd choice, especially if you implement it for some types but not others. I understand the want of the language designers to protect people from these mistakes, I just think they chose an oddly inconsistent way of of doing so. The logical conclusion of different operators for different types is many more operators than shown here, so that leaves the language with these special cases. Special cases cause confusion.

When you see someone posting a Rossmann video, 9 times out 10 if you look at their history it isn t some guy concerned about repairing his iPhone or MacBook.You are barely comprehensible.Louis literally owns a company that repairs MacBooks. And if you cared to watch his channel a little bit over the years as I did, he build his user base not on ire for Apple but on his expert knowledge on how to repair their products.The channel is not just for people who want to repair their MacBooks. The channels are for people who maybe at some point were interested in MacBook repair I went in for board diagnosis but then stayed because Louis had something more to say. The guy is monetizing a certain base. Probably doing pretty well out of it.Is this jealousy I am hearing?Is this a proof he isn t right?EVERY channel on youtube with large userbase is earning some money.

Defending colonial-era archeological plundering gets close to racism fast, and what s said here, to the tune of what right do they have to their ancient culture, it s changed from the past anyway is already heavy on racism and colonial entitlement.The next step would be to invoke the white man s burden to protect those artifacts and have them in a nicer museum than the natives ever could.All the while ascribing nationalism to the people s connection to their culture because arbitrary removal of artifacts from their original land and keeping them for display on an colonial power s capital, full of other stolen artifacts from all over the world, is cosmopolitan .
2009-09-01 17:55:00.000	xcompmgr is a Composite manager. It will run along side any other window manager that doesn t already do compositing... this excludes Compiz, newer KWin, Xfce4 s window manager, but exactly what would happen if you tried to run xcompmgr and Compiz at the same time I don t know . It just does things like add drop shadows around windows and enable true transparency. edit You can configure the drop-shadows or disable them through command-line options edit I said stomach because xcompmgr has been unstable at times in my experience. IIRC, none of the xcompmgr crashes have taken down X11 or the window manager. I have not used it in a while though so it may have changed, but I was under the impression that it doesn t get much work done on it. It s original goal was just to be a reference example implementation of the compositing extension for X. I could be wrong though and it might be in a more stable state now.If anything you might be motivated to see if there is a way to run it with debugging information. I can t imagine it s highly complex in the way that I assume Compiz is. It might be fairly easy to do some fixing up of it, as long as a person is motivated to look into it.

2021-01-10 09:53:34.000	Freedom of Association An individual s right to join or leave groups voluntarily, the right of the group to take collective action to pursue the interests of its members, and the right of an association to accept or decline membership based on certain criteria.There is clear conflict with how our society views the roles of private companies vs. individuals, the technology driven communication platforms they provide, and how individuals and groups use those platforms.However, it is not a forgone conclusion that censorship by private organizations and individuals via platforms they control is a violation of freedom of speech.No one has the right to forcibly silence someone else, with governments being only one of many traditional perpetrators with means and motives to do so. But individuals and groups cannot forcibly enlist others to help spread their message. My local church can t force me to espouse my love for their god, nor am I forced to listen to a random passerby on the street.These 2 principals can be easily agreed with in theory, as requirements for a well functioning society. But with technology, comes the ability to convert capital into speech, and those 2 principals come into natural conflict. The written language, the printing press, the internet, etc. are all tools that can be used in conjunction with capital to amplify speech, and drown out the speech of others via shear volume. It isn t necessary to silence someone else, if yelling over them achieves the same effect.Thus continues the ever-lasting compromise and conflict between our rights as individuals. There is no free lunch, no easy solution.

Countries are going deeper and deeper in debt every year.The healthcare budget is a rather small part of the total government budget, a small increase is probably too small to register on the radar. But if it does, one might assume that the government would rather keep healthcare running, especially given the circumstances, and cut money anywhere else.To make a comparison for US readers. Healthcare in Europe is like freedom of speech in the US. It s deeply ingrained in each citizen and cannot be taken away.

2019-06-15 17:45:53.000	The paper does not have any redeeming qualities and the title and abstract do not even align with the content.In my opinion, conversation and other high level skills are sort of the icing on the cake of general intelligence. I believe that the key abilities that enable general intelligence are those that humans share with many other animals.So I think that a research goal of animal-like intelligence will give the most progress as long as the abilities of more intelligent animals like mammals are the goal.I think that people who have worked closely with animals or had a pet will more easily recognize that.Animals adapt to complex environments. They take in high bandwidth data of multiple types. They have a way to automatically create representations that allow them to understand, model and predict their environment. They learn in an online manner.No software approaches true emulation of the subtleties of behavior and abilities of an animal like a cat or a dog.Obviously it s another step to say that leads to human intelligence. I m not trying to prove it, but will just say that it seems mainly to be a matter of degree rather than quality. If cats and dogs are not convincing for you, look at the complexity of chimpanzee behavior.So this is just a half baked comment on a thread, and I would not try to publish it, but I don t think that the paper is actually much more rigorous and yet we are supposed to take it seriously.arxiv is amazing and we should not change it, but you have to keep in mind that there is literally zero barrier for entry, and anyone s garbage essay can get on there with the trappings of real academic work. So you just have to read carefully and judge on the merit or total lack thereof.

2019-02-26 10:14:23.000	What worries you about the 100K number and what would a better number be?I can t imagine the point.The whole architecture just sounds ridiculous. Alternatively it s 100 servers with a connection pool of 1,000 each. 100 app servers isn t excessive and if you re doing less than 10K concurrent on each of them then there s other profiling opportunities to be had there.Even 100 app servers is stupid. 4 second response time is stupid. Just build two big ones. I can handle low tens of trillions of queries per day on a single box low µs response time, pipelined -- and the only reason I even need two is because one might die for uncontrollable hardware reasons.The only reason I ever buy more servers than two is because I want geographic diversity, and I can cover the world with ads with around 10 pops. I can t imagine having 100k pops sending MySQL queries to a single place.So yeah I would really want to hear the use-case here.One time I met a company who insisted they were sending tens of TB of data per day and would need multi-PB per year storage compressed. Took one look at the data All json, all GUIDS and bools. If we just pre-parse it, the entire dataset for a year fits in a few 100s GB uncompressed -- literally could fit on a macbook air for most of the year. Absolutely insane the kind of build-out people do to win at numbers that don t matter...

Their explicit goal is to match the behaviour of another piece of software with a translation layer.Forbidding people who have seen the source programm is most likely to protect their version from going from matching behaviour to behaving like , as in the same code, point. This might also be intended to build a safeguard for good intentioned developers to not break their most likely existing own NDAs accidently.
2010-02-23 10:57:39.000	Agreed. Most papers, even good ones, are hard to understand because the subject matter is hard. They are written with the assumption of a certain amount of prior knowledge of the field, and depending on the intended audience, very little background might be explained.Writing clearly is also remarkably difficult and not everyone can do it. I have often found that the initial exposition of a scientific concept is not the easiest. After it been been digested by the community for a while, clearer ways of explaining it might be found.Now, there are controversies like the Bogdanov papers, and even successful hoaxes like the famous Sokal paper, but I think these are exceptional, and usually reviewers _will_ say that a paper is flat out bad despite, or even because of obfuscation.

Inflation destroyed working class wages. We spent more on Covid by any measure than we spent on WWII. And we had mortality rates similar to countries that did next to nothing. Even China, which is the only major economy that could stay locked down forever, decided to finally accept reality and move on.Next time let s be more clear eyed and protect the vulnerable with targeted interventions, encourage people to pay attention to their general health, and not just think we can hit pause on the global economy without messing everything up.

2022-01-10 19:29:12.000	Certainly there is value in having an antagonistic press, but the gotcha here is a lie.Throughout the pandemic numbers have reported how many people where hospitalized with Covid. Because that is the important number to be concerned about, since this is the number that is pressuring the hospital system. This articles is Henrik Qi s personal gotcha saying haha, I told you so, actually only 3 4 of those hospitalizations are because of covid!! And then trying to paint a picture of the media collectively having failed the readers for not discovering this earlier.Now this is a lie for two reasons, it implies incorrectly that there was previously a statement that 100 the people in the hospital with covid where there solely because of covid, which was never the case. And secondly it is a lie because the hints that covid is actually 27 less severe is an implicit accusation that someone who has covid and heart failure and is admitted does not stress the system exactly as much as someone admitted only because they have covid.The punkis wasn t lied to by the government. The media didn t fail the people. What actually happened was that the most important number was reported accurately and now Henrik Q finally got another number that he thinks is more important. Why does he think that one is more important? Because he doesn t care about the healthcare system failing, what he cares about is only his personal risk of ending up hospitalized if he gets covid. And that s fine, it s not illegal to be selfish, but it s not a failing of the government for not focusing on metrics you personally align with your own hypothesis.It was quite clearly communicated and makes perfect sense that during covid we where looking at number of hospitalizations with covid compared to the capacity to support hospitalizations with covid, and lockdowns and other actions where planned based on ensuring those didn t collide.If the hospital system had broken down, it would have helped no one that Henrik could jog along and go Well actually 27 of the people that can t get treatment for covid or other illnesses only need that because of the other illness not because of covid Anyways I appreciate your perspective but I ll stand by my viewpoint. The truth contained in this reporting is incidental to their agenda, it s not the focus of it at all.

It s just a matter of ensuring that the bibtex entry has an URL or a DOI, and most bibtex entries copied and pasted from curated sources already have them.If you are finding many papers without hyperlinked references, it s probably just because they re published in journals whose templates don t support it. In my particular research field, most publication venues templates starting supporting those links around 3-4 years ago, so my papers from, say, 2015 have no hyperlinks in references, while those from 2019 do. This didn t require any significant extra effort on my part, in fact in general it requires less because well-curated bibtex entries are easier to come by now than some years ago.

2021-02-08 22:50:18.000	What is the source of some people s persistent desire to legislate, regulate, punish, mock or vilify other people s loving relationships?Western morals are still primarily rooted in Judeo-Christian beliefs which see any sexual expression other than heterosexual, monogamous sex within Christian marriage to be sinful, or at least taboo. The Bible condemns homosexual sex but in theory not homosexuality itself, as the heterosexual homosexual dynamic is a modern invention which would not have existed at the time, but in practice Christendom considers any orientation besides heterosexuality to be at best a form of sexual deviance and immorality, sometimes seen as equivalent to pedophilia and bestiality, and at worst and affront to God.LGBT sexuality is also often seen as undermining the mainstream paradigms of masculinity and femininity, and by extension gender roles, and by further extension the traditional foundations of society itself.

Reasons - It s too new - not Lindy.- I am reasonably convinced that I had it back in February, when people were not talking about it. It was very different from every year that I got the flu and I experienced anosmia, which never happened before. I still take all the precautions possible, but for all intents and purposes, I consider myself already immunized.- I m already working from home, my social life is the one of a parent of two small kids - i.e, almost non-existent, occasionally meeting small groups of either family or close friends. My parents are on the other side of the ocean and aside from them I haven t much interaction with people that could be at-risk.- If herd immunity is achieved with 60-70 vaccination, why take the risk when the social butterflies and those with key activities health care workers, teachers, people working in retail will likely be rushed to take it?

On the other hand, the vaccines seems to producer a stronger immune response, as stated above, so that might be better if the antibodies still mostly line up? Honestly, even if I had Covid before, it seems to make sense to get vaccinated anyhow. It s free man, why aren t all vaccines free? , Your employer is very unlikely to give you a hard time for getting it, or taking some time off for recovering from the common side effects of the second dose - it feels like the potential benefits stronger immunity outweigh the very limited risks basically limited flu symptoms and a possible bruise at the injection site .As a weird side note, at least among my cohort, the side effects seem to be a really clear marker of who s immune system recognizes the disease. My friends who didn t catch it all reported no problems the first time and symptoms on the second shot. My friends who tested positive reported symptoms from the first shot. I had to start immunosuppression after the first shot, but before the second TNF Alpha Inhibitor , and the symptoms at the second shot were actually a relief that my immune system hadn t been tamped down too hard...

There is -definitely- something wrong at their senior level, and the majority of BlackBerry users I know are only holding on out of ignorance it has business features , or because of BBM which will soon change due to Apple s messenger . There has been zero intelligent innovation out of this company for years, and my friend at RIM makes money shorting their stock. The entire culture is out of whack, and I doubt they can restructure this by themselves.I remember an article here a few days ago, about how Silverlake I think it was Silverlake did some crazy restructuring. RIM is dying. Their best hope is for an external firm to step in and overhaul things completely.

RIM is a Canadian company, and from my experience as a Canadian who went to school in Waterloo , Canadian companies like management - they are incredibly top heavy. This is especially true in the case of RIM - my friends there tell horror stories of how hard it is to make changes or even coordinate between teams. In contrast, I ve found American companies err almost too far on the other side - not enough management to give some structure. So you have a lot of people who delegate, and not many people to actually do things, and nobody to organize the mess. Three bosses? I think yes.2. They also don t pay very well. Out of school, my offer from RIM as a software developer was just over half of the offers I got from Microsoft, Amazon and co. So they re not getting the A team, or the B team, or really even the C team. To be fair, Waterloo is not nearly as expensive as Seattle or San Francisco, but still, as a whole they end up with the developers who are either unambitious this is the best case, because many of these people are very smart , or just not very hard working. There are a lot of retirees too - people who want the 9-5 to raise a family which is not itself bad, but you can t have an entire company made up of people like that . So basically, a whole lot of apathy.3. There s a culture there of yes men. Look at how Laz ran the show - basically, it was a culture of denial that the iPhone even existed look up some quotes from him about the iPhone from 2007 - 2009 . Their product cycle has always been twice as long as the rest of the industry and when they do, it s often incredibly half baked . While I think that Heins is really smart, and I certainly wouldn t want his job, he s stepped into a really broken culture. Their heads have been in the sand for ages.4. If their public APIs development chain are indicative of their internal workings, it s a mess over there - no wonder they can t ship anything. No documentation, poorly build APIs, and an awful, awful simulator although to be fair, the last time I worked with BlackBerry s APIs was right after the iPhone came out, so they may have improved . It s a mess.5. The ship is sinking! Anyone who can get a job elsewhere is going to get out as soon as they can. And why would people crunch to get the project out the door, if they think that they are going to get laid off anyway in six months? Nobody s getting raises, nobody s getting bonuses.I would love for RIM to succeed, but it s much more than the market that is holding them back.

2019-05-24 20:12:33.000	If you take away the right for anti-vaxxers or climate change deniers in the OP s case to talk about things on a public platform where they re actively ridiculed, they re going to go underground and create their own communities under the radar.Say someone goes to that community to try and convince them otherwise and says hang on, vaccines don t cause autism, here s some research articles , they ll get banned and their post removed, and everyone in the separate community is none the wiser and nobody who uses that community will ever have the chance to be convinced otherwise.So if you really wanted to stamp out the anti-vaxxers, I guess you d have to have some kind of monitoring to make sure they don t post anything anywhere about anti-vaxx views. That would need to be done by someone or something powerful, say... Facebook or the government? I don t trust Facebook as their ulterior motive is selling your data for sweet sweet ad money, and I don t trust the government as many governments have shown in the past many times they can t be trusted to regulate speech of citizens not that I would EVER want to regular speech So - why not just let them speak on large public platforms and have them get laughed at?

I honestly thought that s what I was meant to do the API should be optimized for power, and the local wrapper for usability in the local context.But it s also a matter of style. I just wrote a function the other day to do the equivalent of Map m makeMap key1 , value1 , key2 , value2 , key3 , value3 It s perfectly ok to write something like this in java using varargs, but because of ...

So, sure, fraud happens and clearly that s bad.

This outcry would ve been minor if reddit had a male CEO without the failed lawsuit in the rear view mirror.Reddit has harbored toxic subreddits for long enough that they ve nurtured a huge user base of racists and misogynists. It s a demographic crisis and it apparently doesn t take much to incite these mobs. These vocal and active users hated Pao before she became reddit CEO and these events were entirely predictable. 1
2021-08-27 16:31:06.000	There have actually been studies done on this. The estimate I ve seen is that for every year of life that would be prolonged by mandating helmet use in NL, 25 years of life would be lost from the loss of exercise by people who don t take bike trips because they are put off by helmet wearing. This is a real thing that has to be taken into account.The other interesting stat is that an hour of bike riding in NL carries approximately the same risk of head injury as an hour in a car in the USA. So, should we make all car passengers wear helmets? It would make them safer

This is at least partially represented in the first sale doctrine. For a car, you have a literal entitlement document showing that you own it. What you re not entitled to is any help from the manufacturer to do so, except that repairs can t void a warranty if those repairs didn t cause the problem being warrantied. With regard to batteries, there s no reason someone who owns a Tesla shouldn t be able to replace or upgrade the battery they own on the car they own.

2024-06-14 20:37:13.000	Pretty much. I ditched my Facebook account in 2017 and never really messed with IG. At some point I just wasn t seeing much of what I liked about the site initially a feed of what friends and acquaintances were up to and didn t find it worth the tradeoff - lots of companies are skeevy, but I might continue using their products if I get something out of them. Didn t find FB to be worth it.But still, I m in a few long running group chats with friends and maybe 60-70 of the links people post are to Meta sites. Can t access even though it s almost always just something reposted from a openly accessible website.The bots and the spam ruining platforms is bad enough. Putting such a large chunk of actual online human conversation behind login-walls has seriously put a dent in things. I feel like this is the other half of the whole search engines suck now because of ML-generated SEO-optimized junk argument. There s nothing to balance that stuff out because you need a sketchy persistent, personally-identifiable account to access the rest.

2020-10-01 01:45:25.000	What we have right now is partially privatized schooling with a public back-up. The private schools don t have to deal with the problem of capacity in general, and in the geographic distribution of capacity in particular. They don t have to provide capacity for special needs kids.You can choose a prime location to build a private school for 100 kids, and be reasonably assured that it will be filled with 100 kids. If not, it shuts down and the kids go elsewhere or back to the public schools. This happens sometimes.And while the training of teachers is certainly a worthy matter of debate, the hiring of teachers by public schools is coupled with a standardization of teacher training and a guarantee of reasonable wages thanks to the union.I predict where it ends is a small number of companies form an oligopoly of private school operators that are perpetually bailed out by the government. I also predict the emergence of local or even regional school deserts where families have no school options.
2016-08-26 22:59:26.000	I m not sure why you think anyone who disagrees with you hasn t done any reading on the topic. As it happens, I m against drug prohibition on personal liberty grounds. I just don t think it s reasonable to put on social justice blinders and assume drug laws exist because teh racism.If you spend even a little time around a junkie it s not hard to see the logic behind making addictive substances illegal. It may be a misguided impulse, but these laws are an attempt to address a real problem.

I would like you, or John Smith from Marketing, to restore backward-compatible partnerships between our team leads. That way we can continually seize efficient human capital. That will really synergise with our stakeholders. What do you think? And you can respond to whatever they say with a thinking nod while stroking your chin. And street-kids would say bet , you simply say hmhm, very agile. You ll be CEO in no-time.
2013-05-28 01:45:16.000	No, of course it does not become less secure. In the worst case, slapping some crypto onto a system would have no effect at all it is hard to see how it could make things worse, other than to give people a false sense of security.An example is Hushmail. Your mail is signed, it is encrypted, you re using the tried-and-true PGP...and the DEA can walk into court with a pile of DVDs full of the plaintext of some defendant s email. Hushmail is, at best, only marginally more secure than GMail.So while we might come up with good practices for using cryptography, it is inevitable that organizational practices will render the cryptography pointless. Solutions need to be tailored to the specific needs of an organization or a system. That is where the real problem lies we do not have something like SQL for cryptography. We do not have a good way to specify organization needs and design or even verify the security of a cryptosystem that meets those needs.

2024-05-16 22:45:17.000	Yeah, it s almost comical the degree to which quantity has become emphasized over quality. More than a few times I ve clicked through to an AI posters profile out of morbid curiosity and seen that they have thousands or even tens of thousands of uploads despite being active for less than a year or so. Even with the supposed productivity boosts that AI brings you can t convince me that someone posting 20 pieces every single day like clockwork is putting any real consideration into them, but the magic of AI is that something with little time and zero thought put into it can still be superficially passable.

2018-09-25 02:39:44.000	Even very good doctors often don t know the state of the art procedures and treatments for their craft, as I have personally discovered since a close family member began receiving cancer treatment. From my experience, the vast majority of doctors response to bringing up experimental treatments or care - or even recently approved, well-researched treatments - is a mindless affirmation of that s the future , meaning they don t know anything about it. If you press them, most will say that they prefer to start patients with XYZ, which means I want your business but don t know about that treatment . This happened to my own sick relative, a pharmacogenomics researcher, who said it reminded him almost exactly of trying to get clinicians to incorporate basic gene panels into their practice e.g. don t give this patient warfarin because they have this gene which will make them bleed to death .As a society we are much too afraid to call shitty doctors shitty doctors. Having parents in medicine, I grew up hearing about them all the time.I do believe that most doctors would not consciously and maliciously decide to sacrifice people s health for money. I also believe that most doctors aren t particularly diligent about keeping up to date on medical information throughout their careers for every developer with 30 years of experience who has treated a job as a job and worked with the same tech staff for all his life without bothering to learn new ones, there s a doctor doing the same with medicine.

In practice this is difficult but not impossible to achievesedachv s words What you re really saying is that working against the development of surveillance and control technologies by private capital and government decision makers is hard and so is not practical. Those look like exactly the same statement to me. There is not a single practice that just happens to be some bad guy opposing FLOSS because he hates your freedoms. And once again, that s something I never said, nor inferred....that sentence is not accusing you of saying that practice is a person. sedachv is pointing out that practice is not a coherent whole, that s all.I don t know why you re accusing sedachv of twisting words. sedachv merely accused you of being intellectually lazy for using difficulty to declare something as not practical.

Also there was some kind of thing earlier this year about coronavirus being a hoax to scare the elites into saying indoors to make them easier for trump to arrest them lol But that said the general idea that powerful people can get away with pedophilia and probably all sorts of other crazy stuff should be undeniable by now given Epstein and his associates

I am happy to pay extra for quality when it feels justified.The new watch band is a ripoff not because of its intrinsic price quality proposition but because I can no longer look at it think sounds about right for a quality product . This isn t intrinsically Apple making a price point choice, this is the entire global economy shifting at a rate faster than my brain as a consumer can keep up. I can t as a rational consumer be expected to do research into global fabric watch band production, long term elasticity and sweat resistance, and decide that 60 in AUD is a good price for the item in question, my brain has multiple decades of prior data built up into the kinds of simple heuristics that everyone develops, and these heuristics based on past economic data set off the fuck off mate, that s too much for that thought in my brain and thus Apple loses a sale.This sort of subconscious sometimes conscious thought process is going to be happening thousands of times a day in Apple stores... and it s made worse because the more clued in customers know that Apple could sacrifice some of their ludicrously juicy profit margins to try and mitigate this feeling their customers are starting to experience but we all know they won t do that because that s not good business, which just sharpens that feeling of fuck off, that s too much because we know not only are they making a premium product that will cost us more, we know they are deliberately choosing to exploit the trust we have in them to make quality products, to overcharge for those quality products because we aren t necessarily sure where else we will get sufficiently good quality.When everyone in the world except the richest people and companies are making less money because of inflation related margin squeezing, the richer the company the more egregious it looks and this runs the risks of alienating customers from the brand, or more likely, driving down ancillary sales as customers can only justify the main device and buy fewer accessories, perhaps eventually even hurting Apple s beloved Customer SAT isfaction metrics they are so proud of. I know I ve been less satisfied with the products for years now based almost entirely on the price. Like I said, I don t mind paying extra for quality, I resent being taken to the cleaners for it.

Most buildings in Houston, for example, forgo a basement and instead have a collecting vault underneath them that the rain drains into and from and leaves more slowly and sustainably . There are fields set aside to ensure that there s land that can flood with minimal impact. County flood control districts will buy up property just to let it be undeveloped.There are ways to mitigate the risks of living in a flood plain while still reaping the benefits.

2014-07-27 15:41:13.000	What s more important than changing the behavior of Joe User is changing the behavior of Joe IT , who makes the tools Joe User uses. Adding end-to-end encryption to highly popular services, making it very easy to use, or even making it all work in the background without Joe User even knowing about it, is much more effective and faster than teaching every single Joe Use to use end-to-end encryption.Imagine if Hangouts and Whatsapp added end-to-end encryption to their services, the way TextSecure works. BOOM - 1 billion people now using end to end encryption, most without even realizing it. That s as world changing as it can get, and hopefully, something like this will eventually happen on popular platforms.Changing the behavior of Joe Tech Evangelist is also extremely important. Joe Tech Evangelist is basically what caused Chrome to go from 0 percent market share to 50 percent market share in some stats . Google s advertising of Chrome didn t do nearly as much as every tech guy out there pushing Chrome onto their families and friends, who were still using IE, and some even Firefox.And if Joe IT doesn t make the kind of services that offer really strong encryption and security, he should be very worried Joe Tech Evangelist will push users towards the platforms that have it anyway, and eventually lose its userbase. But it obviously won t happen overnight, and it also depends on the commitment of Joe Tech Evangelist to do this.

But it does not understand that this extremely power-dense source has no true substitute, until it is too late.

2024-05-27 17:50:49.000	No, they re still intertwined, unfortunately.For example, Okta has a notion of whether a user is authorized to use the app, so you can end up being directed to Okta, prompted to log in, and then shown an authorization error. Users will often phrase this as some odd form of not permitted to log into the app .Further, Okta admins control the claims the user presents to the app, and those claims can often have authz implications. A role or group claim is the most obvious one.I ve spent endless time going in circles with Okta administrators who can t clearly delineate these two, or who don t understand what an app Okta s term for a relying party is, etc.
2021-01-31 04:25:58.000	No, thanks. I am not interested in helping you whitewash their history. It is common public knowledge that the founders of RSS were an admirer of Hitler and his party. And they still continue to admire and glorify Hitler . The RSS is also a thrice banned terrorist organization whose members are involved in various communal riots and also assassinated Gandhi.And no, Subhash Chandra Bose is not a Nazi because he didn t embrace their ideology. He was a secular and left-leaning revolutionary who believed that the British could only be overthrown by violence and revolution, and thus relied on the opportunist political maxim that the enemy of my enemy is my friend to ally with Germany and Japan. While an inspiring figure in indian politics and its freedom movement, his politics was ultimately foolish, as the Japanese occupation of some parts of India, with his army s support, highlighted - the imperial army of Japan considered us as second-class citizens, as did the Nazis, and showed it with the brutality against the indian citizens in the occupied territories.

2019-12-17 08:06:16.000	I m in Madison now. Nobody is actually in charge, but all the CDs are still at the storage facility for now. It s truly an impressive sight.The person answering the CDreturns2u email address has collected some money from customers and is paying 3 of the last employees to slowly ship media out. He s overloaded with requests and is attempting to answer each one in order, but has several hundred still in the queue. Even sending all requested media back can t solve the whole situation here though. There s just too many disks and not enough time.I met with one of the creditors and the landlord, and have a meeting scheduled with the other major creditor. Nobody wants to see the CDs thrown away, but the landlord wants to be paid. I ve proposed a plan to move all the media to my facility where I could store it as long as needed and would handle all the returns. I d also work to restore digital access for media still in storage.There is still hope. Maybe even the start of something better? I ve been procrastinating on the launch of Crossies.com for far too long, but it looks like fate is forcing my hand.

When Twitter was created, many people didn t understand what purpose it served compared to, say, a blog post or Facebook status update.However, when you re operating in untested waters like this, you need to create some sort of platform that allows people to play around with what you have.

Look at the differences in traditional Italian food and Italian American food.Dealing with virtually unlimited quantities of food is a very recent problem, and Americans were the first to have this problem at scale.Most of the rest of the world now has this problem too. If you look at overweight trends, most developed countries are about were America was 30 years ago 1 .There are other differences as well. For one, America was the first country with ubiquitous car ownership--contributing to lower population density and less walking, more time sitting, and drive through restaurants. 1

2014-06-08 05:03:27.000	The core of the issue if any is that historically, the patent system is inextricably tied into the free-market laissez-faire economic system, which for all its flaws, did create the world as we know it for the last 200 to 300 years which led to an exponential rise in technological development - a unique phase started in the Western world, where now some of the successful and well-developed countries in the Eastern world e.g. Japan, South Korea, Singapore have incorporated into their respective systems.From Stallman s article which did show up here law was intended to promote the publication of useful ideas, at the price of giving the one who publishes an idea a temporary monopoly over it a price that may be worth paying in some fields and not in others. The real question is does all software patents come in the last part of the aforesaid sentence ..... a price that may be worth paying in some fields and not in others. A knee-jerk reaction to throw out the baby out with the bathwater by abolishing the whole patent system may not be the right solution here.

2023-03-22 20:13:27.000	Nuclear is extremely price competitive if you actually force carbon producing power generation methods to pay to clean up the pollution they emit. Which is something we require of nuclear but for some reason not any other.Price competitive with fossil fuels. Still 10x the cost of renewables. Please do implement a carbon price though.Also they don t clean up. There are unremediated uranium mines, nuke plants, mills, and plutonium separation facilities all over the world that are just left for the public to deal with while any money set aside is embezzeled or is only a fraction of what is needed for cleanup. This is both a solved problem and also a non-problem. Advanced nuclear reactor designs have effectively zero waste.Closed fuel cycles are not a thing.It s never happened. It s not on the drawing board. No series program is trying. The one reactor that allegedly could have a breeding ratio over one is used in a plutonium shell game and achieves nothing other than a small boost in fuel economy for some other reactors and to keep some weapons grade plutonium ready.Reprocessing does nothing other than spew fission products everywhere.

2010-01-26 19:46:52.000	Elegant, and one seems to follow from the other. The only problem is that the analogy is wrong.Copyright seeks to improve customer choices by creating profit incentives. Those who are willing to invest can create, and those who are willing to buy, vote with their wallets. One hand washes the other, and copyright law simply maintains the proper incentives for the system to work.Censorship in China seeks to maintain a central focus of power by suppressing alternative ideas or organizations, which when shown the light of day might be more popular. There is an inherent conflict of interest which leads to depriving citizens of the ability to control how they are governed.So whereas copyright preserves profit incentives but leaves the market to decide the winner, censorship in China puts one product on the table CPC PLA , and prevents others from being considered.

I test drove a lot of premium vehicles last year and found most of them were using engines drivetrains that were still based on 15-20 year old designs with only cosmetic and cabin electronics changes over the years.So in that sense, the Model S is a baby in terms of maturity of the vehicle platform.
2016-12-06 23:42:12.000	I don t read that as being the point of the article. Regulation is not even mentioned or alluded to. Also, my understanding of regulatory capture has little to do with regulation slowing down business. If anything, rather the opposite. But that s off-topic anyway, and definitely not appropriate for this week.Edited to update comment on regulatory capture.

2014-09-04 11:25:02.000	Simultaneous localization and mapping SLAM essentially refers to various algorithms to determine egomotion how much a robot moves in an environment using sensors, while building a map at the same time.Essentially, at each time step, the algorithm senses its environment and checks how much it differs from the previous time step, and figures out if it saw any new features to add to the map and how much the correlated features between the two time steps moved, to infer egomotion. This doesn t have to be necessarily with cameras, it can also be done with laser rangefinders and other relatively accurate sensors.Monocular SLAM MonoSLAM, also the name of a well known paper is SLAM done with a single camera, which makes the problem harder than with two cameras. With two cameras affixed to a rigid frame and known characteristics, it s possible to determine the 3D position of any given feature that is seen by both cameras at the same time. With a single camera, however, it s trickier because only the angle of a given feature can be determined, not its 3D position, so an optimization step has to be done to determine what the likeliest solution to the problem is.There s also more to read on the relevant Wikipedia article, at

Here are some prime examples from Intel I have no evidence to support otherwise, but I would not doubt it.

2023-05-19 01:34:57.000	I think Apple wouldn t ship this if it wasn t a very, very good AR headsetFor heaven s sake, Apple has a laundry list filled history of releasing half baked and subpar products - both hardware and software - and has been reliably consistent at doing that. I mean it s just that its target audience sets their peak of standard what Apple expects them to, or to just what Apple offers.I have been using their AirPod Pro 2 and I have also tried one by Jabra and Samsung along with XM4 and 700 - I own ed these two and my goodness the noise cancellation and call quality, in even slight noise, is atrocious. That s just one example don t even get me started on their software and services suite.

This is great because the quality of experience watching tv on the ESPN app is way better than on the Sling app, which at least for me, on the Apple TV sometimes has pretty bad buffering problems.
2017-08-08 08:30:10.000	This might be a stupid question, since I don t know how the US system works - if you have health insurance, why do you have to pay anything for drugs covered by your insurer? If they cover a medication, why is there anything left to be paid by you? Do you also have to pay if you have any treatment that is covered by your insurer?

2021-05-15 23:59:27.000	I suppose. It just feels weird that the post was highlighting hooks and context, while VDOM was omitted. VDOM was easily the biggest thing in my opinion. I had never seen anything like it and it worked wonderfully. It s not to say that everything else in React is bad, it s more like everything else pales in comparison to how huge VDOM was when it was introduced.Kinda like hyping iPhones innovation without ever mentioning touch screens.
2020-07-15 13:41:01.000	Employees in warehouses are low wage and hire and fire jobs. The CEO is getting richer and richer, not everyone is profiting as well as it could be.same old argument that marx has - that capital ownership and by extension, capitalism is the cause for such inequality.I personally don t think all inequality is the same, and inequality is what drives people. There s a reason why communism, and their strive for equality, has so far failed as a form of governance, and as a form of market economy.
2020-01-08 17:13:03.000	I get what you re driving at, but unfortunately with auto-updating game platform delivery systems like Steam, this is sort of the way the world works. I m sure there are dozens of MMOs with the same arbitrary code execution.Hell, if you re using any browser extensions in firefox chrome, you re effectively open to the same vulnerabilities. which did in fact happen, somebody s Chrome dev account was hacked and malicious code was injected into the extension which affected all end users .

So, this is contextual not absolute, in terms of its efficient I think this is an amazing engine, but I bet there are a tonne of corner cases around it. Massive amounts of high-frequency vibration, under continuous compression to force this to be stationary inside a magnetic inductive system.It sounds hah! like it might be efficient, and even capable of being silent but I begin to suspect that HF is going to be unavoidably imparted to the hull and the surrounding waterscape.

That amount of energy can t be found in renewable sources only.How much of a slave master am I?
2023-07-14 13:05:05.000	The real world is full of project leader who do everything in their power to know as soon as possible how much work and time are required, still they never get the right answer until the project is completed.They don t know the true answer until the project is complete.If my boss asks me how much time I need to integrate with some client system and I say I estimate one week, then if it s ready after four weeks that might be just fine for my boss.My boss knows that there are factors that can affect the delivery of a project. What he almost always wants to know is are we talking days, weeks, months or years? Development is what makes a project successful planning is what makes a project late.So when you travel to new places, you just head in the compass direction? No looking at maps or similar?
2022-09-07 21:36:46.000	It s not a lame dichotomy. There are loads of people who detest rote memorization and prefer to solve only the problem directly in front of them. Bobby Fischer himself invented his variant because he hated that aspect of the game. I, personally, empathize with this position as a university student who gets higher grades in pure math courses than in the easier applied versions due to the memorization aspect.

2020-12-01 17:51:33.000	It s important to note that the goals of this BEAM JIT are a lot more modest than those other JITs.There s no goal of heroic optimization the optimization goal is really just to remove the overhead of interpretation.This removes the need to apply the JIT only to some code, because it s fairly simple, it s fast enough to apply when the code is loaded, and so all code is JITed to native as it s loaded. Or you re on an unsupported platform and all code is interpretted.Because it s all or nothing, testing the OTP release should uncover any JIT bugs you won t have the hard to track bugs sometimes seen in other systems where a function s correctness depends on whether or not it was JITed and that depends on runtime state. That won t mean no JIT bugs, of course, but they should be easier to track down.

2021-11-09 08:32:29.000	This argument is somewhat disingenuous with cherry-picked examples which are highly dependent on Time and Context.Colonialism ruined whole countries leaving them poor, rewrote cultural narratives, uprooted entire social structures and in a word, destroyed peoples histories and a sense of their own independent identity. In the bloody aftermath some flourished and some did not but this cannot be used as an example of the superiority of certain forms of government when the existing forms had been destroyed.A good starting point on further research is the book Why Nations Fail The Origins of Power, Prosperity, and Poverty by Acemoglu and Robinson be sure to read the Critical Reviews section - following two videos though dealing specifically with India under British Colonialism are equally valid as to what had happened to other countries under the British Empire 1 W.r.t. what British Colonialism did to India, see Dr. Shashi Tharoor s longer speech Looking Back at the British Raj in India - Shorter version of above at Britain Does Owe Reparations to India -
2018-04-03 16:08:51.000	It really depends on your position and level of user engagement. Users of Reddit and Craigslist know very well what they want and what to expect. They can navigate a wall of text really quickly because they ve looked at it for countless hours. Strong design can be really critical to onboarding new users or leading down a path. Neither of which are priorities for Reddit or Craigslist.

2015-06-11 21:40:13.000	From an update to the article Update On the conference call, Costolo said he initiated internal conversations about leaving at the end of last year, and that following discussions in Feburary and his decision to step down, Twitter decided to begin the CEO search. Costolo said he chose to leave now because he thought staying on through the CEO search would cause scrutiny to intensify. During the Q A, Twitter execs said that since Costolo voluntarily stepped down, there will be no severance package. The line about no severance package seems highly unusual and would lead me to assume that this was a forceful push to step down.

2022-03-05 05:23:09.000	I would be furious if my ex-employer was giving me bad references just because I wanted to work-from-home or asked for a higher salary. And I would similarly not go around vilifying my ex-employer just because they wanted to offer me a lower salary or have me in the office regularly.That s not similar at all. The employer has all the power and money, not the individual. If the individual did, they wouldn t need to work anymore.

If they changed the value now, nobody would trust the new value and it d lose all meaning.I agree that 2 is too low, but the only way to credibly change the number is prove they take the number seriously by getting back down to 2 before they increase it.

I ve seen a lot of anecdotal stories about things not being covered in the MSM, so yes, people will wonder why there was no news coverage about a boycott, instigated by prominent civil rights groups like the Anti Defamation League, the NAACP, and supported by well known companies like Patagonia, REI et al against a well known company and platform like Facebook.

By default, grep tests patterns, so it s turning all those entries into individual regular expressions. You want to use fgrep, or the -F flag to make it treat all the source matches as fixes strings.In my simple test, that resulting in grep running in 44 of the prior amount of time it required still more than python though .
2012-03-23 22:34:52.000	FB is indeed probably upset because employers were stupid and started asking applicants for their info directly instead of going behind their backs and asking FB for it instead which FB would have happily given them ... for a fee, of course .It s pretty likely FB will quietly roll out a paid background check service which will be hyper-secretive and kept whisper-quiet at the same time they are publicly grandstanding about this issue. In the linked article, there is a link to a second article about a US Senator who is currently crusading on this issue. He comes right out and says there will be exceptions for law enforcement, government contractors, and jobs with security clearances. Look for them to extend those exceptions until social media spying is back to being a de-facto part of applying for a job, any job. They re going to legitimize this while pretending to be fighting it. sounds paranoid, yes ... until it happens

2016-02-02 10:05:59.000	I have mixed feelings about it.I wanted an intellectual challenge and to serve my community, yet what I m mostly doing is glueing libraries I don t even understand together and squeezing out performance and page impressions to make someone I don t care about richer.I wanted to consider myself an artist, not an interchangeable cog in a materialistic machinery. A craftsman that truly cares about his work and learns from others, not blindly following imposed cargo cult and so called best practices with the ultimate goal of optimising for the lowest common denominator and promoting cheap labor.I wanted to learn and discover new things that are truly useful, but what I see is an extreme focus on tooling. The latest new cool framework on the block while showing complete disregard for already existing knowledge and tools.They said technology was to make our lives better, yet it has become a means to an end in itself. I wish for a more perennial school of thought in software, a back to the basis, and I m not even 30.But I have to pay my bills somehow.Then again, we have it much better than other labor in the workforce.

2019-05-13 09:50:06.000	You may buy only clothes that you need and that s great but I m almost sure that you know someone who buys dress for a one night out. Media and celebrities are always showing on the red carpet in new clothes and you never see them in the same clothes again. It is encourage to buy more and more clothes that very often are getting worn couple times and left in the closet forever. Some countries are better or worst at this. Here where I live, a walk-in closets are pretty rare, in USA they seems to be pretty much a standard. Why would you need a closet the size of a small room just to put there clothes of one or two people?
2018-11-13 22:21:42.000	I think the short answer is that there is some learning curve to using Zulip, but once that s done, sending messages like that takes essentially the same amount of time it would in another product.The thing I don t get here is you have two competing claims goals, both of which I could buy in isolation and in fact agree are perfectly reasonable goals, but both of which actively contradict fight against each other. On one hand you believe it d take the same amount of time as before if people would only learn to use the system as designed which I ll take at face value here , but on the other hand you say the medium correspondingly encourages more multi-line, thoughtful posts . Writing more thoughtful messages and coming up with subject lines by definition requires more time... how can it not?
2018-08-04 22:12:20.000	I think that s a little reductive - there is more to it in the same way that there s more to poker than hoping you get dealt a good hand I m sure that s opening a can of worms .It s not a game designed purely for expert bluffers. Everyone I ve played The Mind with has their own tells and quirks - even when they know the rules forbid it - they ll cringe at their hand, tentatively hold a card forward, or lower it to the table. It s just fun to pick up on these and have a laugh about them.I m sure there are people that will rules-lawyer the fun out of it, but with the right crowd this is one of the games I ve been pulling out most frequently recently, and haven t heard a bad thing.
2017-01-28 16:44:06.000	I had the same experience as the OP. My Mac Mini was getting old, and the fan was making a worrisome noise. I wasn t going to buy the latest Mini, since it is very stale, hard to upgrade and expensive for what it is. Funnily enough I was already running Windows on that Mini anyway, so my next computer didn t have to be a Mac. But I did enjoy the small footprint, and I have to say that the Mac is probably the easiest hardware to run Windows on. The drivers have been tested and everything just works.I ended up with the latest Skull Canyon NUC as well. Even though it is thinner than my old Mini, its footprint on my desk is about the same, it s just less square. I m not a fan of the color or the design it seems marketed at teenage gamerzzz, not at the boring middle aged guy who prefers a minimalist Scandinavian style. But that s not very important. I did have to buy the SSD and the RAM separately, I had to install Windows myself so that s no better than buying a Mini to run Windows on , and I did have to hunt for a couple of drivers. I don t know why they don t sell a fully configured machine.Its fan is not as quiet as the Mini, and it has some weird transient behavior when it wakes up from hibernation. It didn t come cheap I maxed pretty much every spec though . It is very fast, it does the job competently, but I don t Love it like I Loved the Mini. Sad that Apple has abandoned this cute nifty little machine.
2022-01-07 05:54:54.000	Also, know that you don t owe your company jack shit. They are not, and will not be loyal to you, ever. Ever. They will cut you at first necessity. Be prepared to do the same at any time. Boss will blame manager, manager will blame you, people will get fired, unjustly or not. Probably unjustly. Bosses never fire themselves, ever. They will always place blame down the line. Always. Bank on it.This is true. Learn it now. It took me far too long in my career because I bought into the work hard and you will be noticed for far too long.Another hard learned lesson HR is NOT your friend. If you believe their training you may think I have a problem at work, let me get HR to help WRONG what you will have is TWO problems and an annoyed string of management.
2023-03-04 07:44:01.000	Yes, I ve just checked my old paper copies and these too have been updated!! sBut seriously, this is the major risk with everything online our just electronic media is general. It really is possible to change history at the press of a button. Cut and paste history.And how would anyone even know this has happened? No one is paying attention. If someone did spot some history editing, why would that get any traction? Who alert the world to it?And with ai to generate reams of bullcrap... my my, most people are going to be in trouble! A connection to truth will become hard to find.There is an answer - and that is to recognise what you know in a strong sense from what you believe on account of something you were told or saw on a screen. You only know what you have personally - the rest is hypothetical.
2017-01-06 10:36:54.000	For one thing, when the tech giants act like dicks - which is getting more frequent nowadays, be sure to complain loudly and gratingly and leave that record for everyone to see. The big companies have much more organized PR than the little folks, so best if you don t pull your punches. Companies don t have feelings, but since software engineers are big suckers for mottos like Don t be evil , your complaints may give them pause. Except FB, where everyone is clearly already tuned out . That may not prevent the lock-in happening, but it will improve the odds of recruiting folks who can help with the more positive strategies.And with that vent out of the way, here are some positive ideas 1. At some point, the giants tend to get too heavy handed for their own good. Try your best to keep alternatives alive until that point.2. If possible, see if you can make the user on-boarding experience of your favorite OSS software much better. Usually it is easy because the standards around documentation user on-boarding are generally pretty poor.3. The reason people usually don t do 2 is that there is no incentive. See if you can figure out a sustainable way to incentivize it. Throwing out a wild idea Say a StackOverflow like gamification website for people who create OSS documentation and fix OSS issues.And if you are one of the committers, help users with their problems when you actually have time to do something about it. FireFox was asleep at the wheel for quite a while not addressing its real defects.

Men want to know how their child is doing, women on the other hand care more about how her child makes her appear socially.I m not sure I think it s constructive to point out differences in gender though. On HN, it automatically triggers me. It s already difficult enough for a women to get a job programming without being harassed or her talent overlooked.Not to mention, how would you feel if every guy trying to help you was actually trying to take a pass at you? Invaded? Creeped out? I dated someone for a few weeks at my last startup but don t really want to see anyone now.If you want to get non-biased information on technology and women, I highly recommend and you run an open source project, definitely consider getting a code of conduct. Any serious project has one by now.

Intel should be considering changing the behavior of its encryption instructions to clear state when an operation is complete or at the request of software. Come to think of it, every CPU designer should be considering an instruction to clear the specified state register set A, register set B when requested by software. Then, the compiler can effectively support SECURE attributed variables, functions, or parameters without needing to stuff the pipleline with some kind of sanitizing code.

2015-09-29 19:17:32.000	This is actually sort of called out in the comments on the post, but I think it bears saying again in my own way.It s deeply disingenuous to compare effortless biologically-determined learning to effortful general learning and think you can apply lessons from one to the other. Even in the example the OP picked, there s a reason that the learners drill the adjective order table, and it s because without the drill they will never learn it at all. Learning a language as a small child is a different process than learning the same language as a late teen or adult, and the results are very different. Even so, I wouldn t bother instructing people in adjective order... if they do never learn it, it s no big loss. On a different, more technical note, OP doesn t quite understand what s going on in the example either. Vietnamese spicy food is perfectly standard English the ordering there is determined by context. Vietnamese spicy food is a subset of spicy food, and will be used whenever it s being contrasted with other spicy food, whereas spicy Vietnamese food is a subset of Vietnamese food, and will be used whenever a contrast is drawn between spicy Vietnamese food and other Vietnamese food. It s correct, however, that in the zero-context case, spicy Vietnamese food is preferred. In my analysis, that s more because people are likely to reify the concept of Vietnamese food , which makes the phrase structure spicy adj Vietnamese food noun rather than spicy adj Vietnamese adj food noun .

2014-07-14 19:24:37.000	No expert on the topic, though it really interests me. Have been drinking EM every day for the past 6 months which has improved my digestion a lot.Thought this comment on the NPR article was really insightful There s so much more to developing a healthy microbiome than just eating yogurt and drinking kombucha, as many people like to claim. It starts at birth. As you travel through the birth canal, you come into contact with many different and important microorganisms through contact with your mother s vaginal fluids and even fecal matter. If you re born via C section, you re starting out at a disadvantage. Then breastfeeding is the next step. Mother s milk is where you get your next dose of a very broad spectrum of microorganisms. Then throughout life, as you come in contact with other people, you eat dirt, you hang around farm animals, etc, these are all mother nature s way of helping you develop that microbiome, which is essentially the core of your immune system. Eating is important too, and one of the biggest problems with our modern food system is that everything is pasteurized, cooked all the way through, sterilized, irradiated, etc. All of the healthy microorganisms that used to exist are being killed.So the point here is that people need to rethink many of their lifestyle choices if they want to heal their guts. Every time you take an antibiotic, you likely suffer much collateral damage because you may be permanently killing beneficial species that you may never be exposed to again. They don t exist in yogurt or kombucha. Either that, or consider fecal bacteriotherapy fecal transplants since it seems to be one of the the most promising new approaches to healing microbiomes.

2023-04-18 19:11:19.000	Wood takes a very long time to saturate enough to properly sink. A partially-floating log in the ocean is sometimes called a deadhead log supposedly named because the bobbing motion of the lighter end of the log resembles a human head, but this feels apocryphal . I cannot find reliable sources for how long it takes for a log to fully saturate with seawater before sinking below the surface. Some sailors have reported seeing the same deadhead for over a decade. While the deadhead is still at- or close-to-the-surface, it is a major hazard for boats. Deadheads have been known to punch through boat keels and destroy propellers and other equipment. After the logs become fully submerged and settle, I do not believe that they decompose rapidly, but again cannot find reliable sources. The state of Florida has a licensed program for Deadhead Logging 0 , but much of the content I ve found about that program is specific to river ecosystems, not oceans.A 2020 article entitled First evidence of microbial wood degradation in the coastal waters of the Antarctic 1 offers a few nice quotes Wood submerged in saline and oxygenated marine waters worldwide is efficiently degraded by crustaceans and molluscs. Our results establish that there is ongoing wood degradation also in the Antarctic, albeit at a vastly reduced rate compared to warmer environments. Historical shipwrecks resting on the seafloor are most likely still in good condition, although surface details such as wood carvings, tool marks, and paint slowly disintegrate due to microbial decay. 0

What is interesting here is that plants from the same clone grown in different climates likely grow at different rates so the counter must be decoupled from cell division. Perhaps accumulation of some metabolite that adds up every season triggers it at some threshold? 1 2 3

2016-12-14 19:49:02.000	Using a random driverless car will be much cheaper than owning perhaps roughly as expensive as taxis would be if there were no taxi driver who needed to get paid . Random cars can be in use virtually all-the-time every day. The portion of costs a single passenger pays will thus be small fraction of the total costs. For a car you own, at least as it works now, you generally pay 100 of costs. So it s not going to cost just a little extra to own your own car as it works now owning a car results in huge levels of waste, while the expensive item sits doing nothing, occupying a valuable parking space.I suppose you could own a driverless car and have it continuously deployed as an income-producer moving other people when you re not using it. That creates a lot of additional headaches and problems, though. E.g., how to make sure it s always available whenever you decide you want it? Or, will it be safe to leave your items in the car when it s used by others? I would guess not .

The license in this case can be anything, even a proprietary one, so it isn t the GPL that s special here.License incompatibilities are certainly possible with proprietary licenses, there s nothing special about the GPL or copyleft from other copyright licenses that grants it magical incompatibility properties. Someone could license you software only to use in industry A while somebody else forbids you from using their software in that industry. There are also plenty of non-free licenses that require use to be non-commercial that could face a similar problem.
2018-12-30 17:21:04.000	This is one place where Cloud Foundry genuinely shines. Part of the architecture of CF is that you have stateful data services provisioned using BOSH, CF s orchestration tool.

2017-03-29 13:06:28.000	The Pounds fell as an immediate result. Since then the economy has been held up by very strong consumer spending which can only last so long in the face of rising prices and increased capital inflows taking advantage of the weaker pound.The decline is not going to be sudden it ll be a gradual thing as companies move staff out and new investment fails to happen.I m guessing that your let s chill and watch comes from a secure position. There are people who 10 increases in prices makes a massive difference and they can t afford to just chill and watch. This is going to have very big consequences.

2024-07-13 07:38:23.000	The gist of it seems to be that Mozilla and ISRG now proxy the tracking data and give aggregated reports to advertisers. And that they handle the data in a way so that neither Mozilla nor ISRG alone can access the unaggregated data.From reading around their documents ... ... it sounds a bit like they route the data through something like an onion network. So nodes in the network do not know what data they are routing and the advertisers get aggregated data without knowing who the users were ... our DAP service, which is a Multiparty Compute MPC system based on Prio ... And the Multiparty seems to be these two Our DAP deployment is jointly run by Mozilla and ISRG. Privacy is lost if the two organizations collude I think this is actually an interesting approach. I don t know whether two parties are enough and whether the specific algorithm used is good. But if it works as advertised haha , it would result in measuring ad effectiveness without compromising user privacy. Which might be a good thing.

2016-04-14 20:18:38.000	I ve actually interviewed with them, before when I was in college. In all honesty, I used to be on the defensive side of things against technical interviews only because I got really nervous and my mind would go completely blank, especially this one time when a BigTechCo hiring manager asked me to sort a LinkedList without using additional space.So after many rejections and rushed algorithms textbooks regurgitations, I decided to start somewhere my well-roundedness counted more than my algorithm implementation skills a big awesome Fortune 20 company too , and actually REALLY take my time to study the ins and outs of being a real World software engineer and ENJOY IT.A year and a half later after graduation, I don t regret my decision at all. My problem-solving and implementation skills have improved tremendously, especially after I discovered Firecode.io, which takes a more pedagogical approach to interview prep than TopCoder or google CodeJam.I live in Seattle and have a few acquaintances who are in tech at various companies Google, FB, Amazon, MSFT.. . My interactions with Googlers have been very pleasant they just seem to be very down to earth compared to other engineers I have encountered, in general. I am not in a rush, though. I am gainfully employed and like my job, so that also drive my job search to be largely serendipitous.

Not only have I happily used all sorts of text editors in my life I use emacs keybindings in Unix shells. Search in your browser with ctrl cmd f.The irony is not lost that this doesn t say to search in my browser using slash. - The page is also unconsciously right that it should be talking about VIM, not vi. VIM happily recognizes the Insert key on my keyboard. Original Joy vi would not have. Even today, nvi ends up swapping the case of a character when I press the Insert key in one terminal emulator.

What happened here?I think the problem becomes that because VC is such an insular environment, no VC firm wants to be caught talking about how portfolio company isn t successful. As a result, they ll politely decline to lead follow-on rounds, but still allowing the startup to tout the investment from top tier VC firm as social proof for the next round.
2023-08-13 09:07:50.000	In general when people mention cost as an issue for cloud, they re narrowly comparing what a CPU core or GB of RAM or disk costs on paper between cloud and datacenter onprem.This completely misses the business case for cloud, and is why these sorts of analyses don t convince that many business folk, and why cloud use continues to grow fast.The business case is that someone else is doing the infrastructure management for you, at commodity prices, but you still have complete, direct control over your resources and ability to easily automate everything.This tends to save much more money than any of your CPU, memory, and disk budget could possibly achieve.It s sort of like saying, instead of taking cars from your corporate fleet to a repair shop when they break, repair them yourself! Just hire some mechanics, build or rent a garage and equipment, and voila! And also, why are you buying electricity from the electric company anyway? Just build a generator next to your office building! Maybe make it nuclear just like some of the big electric companies!For many companies, the just host it in a datacenter argument is no less silly than these scenarios.

Redis is also super as a local cache, and simple to deploy and manage together with the app that uses it.Since you obviously ran some quick benchmarks and concluded that running it locally over a unix socket confused why you would mention time needed on the network ... you tested with local sockets, right? was too slow, you should at least let Antirez know you ve run into a new mysterious performance bug Writing a cache service can be a fun side project, but I doubt you gained anything by doing so except another homegrown part to maintain.
2022-12-29 11:10:17.000	It s not complicated to explain. The model can handle 4000 tokens at once. So all you can do is work with the limitations of this window. You can use part of it to quote the previous interactions, and part of it for the response. If your content is too large, you need to summarise it. There are AIs for that too. If the output is too large, you need to split it in multiple rounds. It is pretty hard to work around this limitation, for example to write a whole novel.I think we need LLMs capable of reading a whole book at once, about 100K tokens. I hope they can innovate the memory system of transformers a bit, there are ideas and papers, but they don t seem to get attention.

People will put down their deposits before it s even announced, wait several months for the launch, and then have a build window potentially in the year timeframe. Although a small number of units, there s an even higher monetary investment and commitment.We ve not seen it to this extent in the affordable scene, but even if you flip it, there s probably enough market demand to be able to wipe your face on the deal if you did want to chase the new shiny thing announced in the meantime which may or may not have extended build times too .That being said, I m with a lot of people here that aren t new car buyers - I know you need new car buyers to have a used car market, but I m not tuned into the mentality of it all.
2018-07-03 16:05:13.000	Back in 2005 I was at school when a local radio station had a water drinking contest. A woman died.You re really oversimplifying this, the contest was to drink as much water without peeing so you could win a Nintendo Wii Don t pee for a wii . If you don t pee you offset your body s electrolyte balance and can die. It s not reasonable to expect most people would know this, and the woman that died obviously did not.
2020-03-08 02:28:07.000	Python programs that do close to nothing still use way more CPU than you would if you were running in the JVM, or Go, C, whatever.Yeah but that s not exactly shocking news to anyone, is it? People generally choose Python for other reasons productivity, library ecosystem, etc. because the performance is good enough for most web apps, and if you reach a traffic level where performance becomes an issue that s a good problem that you can optimize for later. Like Facebook did with PHP, Twitter did with Ruby, etc. But yes, most importantly, Python s asyncio system is completely impacted by these same issues and I would have preferred she address that, as asyncio is part of the standard library now and is way more popular than gevent.Right, the blog post gave me the impression she was calling out the combination of Python Gunicorn Gevent specifically for some reason. But if the underlying goal was to just point out that Python is slow then I am curious what people think the right solution is? Just switch out of Python and use Go or something else?

2022-06-29 16:17:08.000	I will repeat my comment Stop generalizing the country of origin as if it does not matter like the Chinese Comunist Party isn t a threat to the world. - There will always be a ruler, and which ruler is killing, slaving, censoring and selling it s own people as meat tools for foreign companies?- China will kill, torture it s own people and their families if they think they are a thread even if remote to their government party CCP .- China put on a HEAVY surveilance tool and actually forced people to behave like they want using social credit- China is actively removing ANY historical filosophies, tales, traditions, religions that could be a thread to the CCP s beliefs.- Have you ever seen a CCP convention? Their plan is to remove the worlds countries boundaries in order to rule over everything from culture to politics and economics. Australia is suffering a lot on their hands, they even sent spies to patronize elections.
2017-04-24 13:34:16.000	Yeah, this is the real problem. To be clear though the article skimmed over lots of details to remain generally accessible , I was not discussing the release_sock function which releases a lock on a socket 1 . Instead, my code registers a set of function pointers in a struct 2 . While release_sock does have documentation, the function pointer of the same name does not, and the only examples I have are other files of code within the MPTCP protocol implementation. The callback is related to the function, to be sure, and so I should have connected the dots, but this is how we learn.While I was making a baseless assumption, I like to believe that it was baseless because there was not enough available information, and not because I was ignoring obvious sources of information P 1 2

2020-04-29 20:52:47.000	It s 2020, and people are elated to discover that it is possible to transfer a file directly between two systems on the Internet.True story I was giving a guest lecture on network virtualization at UCI and demoing ZeroTier. One student came up afterwords and asked me how traffic could flow between systems without a cloud. Evidently the idea that data could just go directly from point A to point B was utterly, completely foreign to the point that they weren t aware that the Internet could be used this way.
2022-05-14 18:41:36.000	I bought the Anycubic Predator delta 3D printer with a 380mm bed from China 3 years ago for 480 . I have learned to design replacement parts for the things I break. I think it has paid for itself by now. Just yesterday I printed hands for an old cuckoo clock.3D design stores are still in infancy.

2023-09-05 14:51:42.000	I watch a lot of digital nomads posting their Ws on LinkedIn, and for the life of me, I just can t understand why or how someone could just sit and work on a beach. How far are you from WiFi or an Ethernet cable and power? How much sand falls into your ventilation vents? It s sunny and there s glare and there s a ton of bikinied distractions.I can understand working near a beach and then going there on a break, for a quick dip. I don t know if these digital nomad photos are accurate when they ve just set up their notebook with a Mai Tai on a restaurant patio, 25 meters from the rolling surf.I vastly prefer WFH, with all creature comforts, no AirBnB to worry about, quiet solitude.

There are probably visual systems for cleaning these out. Grapes and a lot of perennial fruits are a little oddball in this discussion though, because they are very low impact. For example, you rarely maybe once when first planting have to till or fertilize or spray for weeds and we ve got plenty of biodiversity in the turf.

2016-08-17 14:53:48.000	An un-researched opinion from someone who replaced chef ansible puppet with his own shell-script config-management system I don t have to rewrite my shell-scripts every 6 months when a new version comes out. New updates usually only happen when security issues arise.Shell-scripts tend to be simple. There s not a lot of magic hand-holding going on, which means not a lot of complexity to break things.It keeps you from getting too abstract. Your writing pretty close and specific to what you want it to do, not how it should be .They are typically standalone. It s really easy to have 1 script that solves one problem, and another script that solves another. You don t need a giant code-infrastructure to keep things going.I think config-mgmt tools can be extremely useful if your running a widely-ranged environment. But, you probably shouldn t be running a widely-ranged environment. If you keep things simple, and run as homogeneous as possible, you probably don t need all the added complexity.

2023-04-21 02:28:05.000	Thanks, that s helpful.It seems to me that he s really missing some of the major concerns about AI as it stands today. As often happens with new technology, the old rules that secure rights don t quite fit anymore. E.g., if I were an artist who had spent years developing a unique, recognizable style, I d be furious to have a for-profit company use my work to create something to imitate my art. It s probably not illegal at the moment, but it easily could be down the road, and it regardless raises real ethical questions. I m disappointed to see Gabriel fail to grapple with that here, where his cache as a prominent artist is being used by a for-profit company for their own ends.

2022-12-13 02:24:15.000	I think higher education institutions should be non-profit. I do think there are a lot of financial pressures on most small-medium non-public schools that make them operate in a more business oriented fashion and they must do so to stay open.When I talk about making money I am talking about system utilized by colleges like enrollment CRMs, grading software etc. In most cases the only way those get made and are supported is through for-profit businesses.
2018-03-20 01:43:30.000	Given just how poorly we react to terrorism and sharks, I m not sure if that s the direction I d want to be headed in. I m in favor of automation, but not with Uber s move fast and break things attitude. Responsible, ethical, and careful developments of dangerous technology, even if the danger promises to be reduced compared to the norm in some future iteration, is a must.Keep in mind that some version of killled by robots has been in the zeitgeist of fear for decades now. In that sense, sharks amd terrorists might not be a bad comparison. It will not take much to ruin a good thing automation with typically scummy practices. The important thing to remember is that automation doesn t require the likes of Uber playing fast and loose with it to become a reality.

2022-04-05 08:38:30.000	So you re worried that a very short lived compromise of a SSI federated auth layer can lead to long-lived compromises of everything it grants access to because a short time can be used to generate long-lived auth to third parties?That s a legitimate concern, any compromise of the SSI needs a complete refresh of anything it s touched, including refreshing all API keys, keyrings, etc.Hopefully as the ecosystem matures it ll be easier to en-masse mark an account as compromised and have that status propagate and trigger resets of affected credentials.A similar threat is insider threat, probably actually a greater threat where someone leaving a company could generate tokens which grant them access for long after they ve gone.If reason about how that s typically managed disabling their upstream accounts that gives insight into how to deal with your initial concern, it should be managed in the same way.

In my case I had accidentally attributed a small amount in January quarterly estimated taxes to the wrong year.
2018-06-30 18:17:07.000	One of my favorite Vim tricks which also works in vi is the general technique of piping a specified range of text through a command a Unix-style filter that reads from standard input and writes to standard output , with the output of that command then replacing that range of text.The text can be anything from a single line, some arbitrary range of lines defined via vim marks like a and b or other letters, some paragraphs see example below , to the entire file - and the filter command can be anything at all, too. The Cartesian product of those two things makes it a very powerful technique.An example is this key mapping of the character v to a command that format paragraphs of text using the fmt command 1 map v ! fmt -w 64This says map the letter v to the command following it after the space , which is ! fmt -w 64 which runs pipes ! the current paragraph when at top of a para, the cursor movement defines a para through the fmt -w 64 command, which formats its input text into lines of not more than 64 characters each. I just used v because it was one of the characters that Vim does not already assign a command to - any other available character will work. I have the mapping in my _vimrc on Windows and .vimrc on Unix.With that mapping, I can reformat any paragraph where paragraphs in vim are defined by a blank line either above and below them or both , just by going to the top of the paragraph with and typing v no Enter needed .For example, if I have this single line in a file in vim the quick brown fox jumped the quick brown fox jumped the quick brown fox jumped the quick brown fox jumped the quick brown fox jumped and I press v when at the start of that line, it gets reformatted into this para the quick brown fox jumped the quick brown fox jumped the quick brown fox jumped the quick brown fox jumped the quick brown fox jumped I typically use this technique when writing text content non-programming content, such as documentation, tech articles, blog posts, etc. or sometimes even for block comments of text in programs.You can also create a different version of that formatting command to filter the entire text file through fmt in one shot that would be !Gfmt -w 64 when at top of file, where G moves to the last line , but I tend not to use that approach much, because it sometimes messes up some paragraphs which should not be reformatted. So I do it a para at a time.If you use the sort command instead of fmt, that will sort the range of lines you select, and the sorted lines replace the original lines. This is of course useful in text files and text format data files, but is also sometimes useful in source code, e.g. to sort lines of import statements say in Python or Go - although Go has commands for that , ranges of variable declarations into alphabetical order, array literals, etc. . 1 Fmt is a Unix command, but you can probably get it in many of the Unix subsystems that run on Windows too, like Cygwin, UWin, Windows Subsystem for Linux too . c The command that you run the selected text through, can also be a Unix or Windows pipeline, which makes the technique even more powerful.

2021-08-01 02:21:05.000	Long time employee of one of those companies, here.To believe that there is some dictate about how a story is covered or why that comes from the top is to believe that we are way more organized than reality. Yes, some corporate-synergy exists to cross-promote, especially on morning shows, but when it comes to news, we are usually pushing so close to deadline there s no way to even allow for corporate control.That said, there is a need to meet an ever decreasing budget. That s the parent co s real bias to be cheap.
2013-06-12 19:42:00.000	The other problem is departments which are net revenue generating e.g. USPTO who can t apply their revenues to operations.

2016-02-01 13:45:31.000	I ve purchased what I thought was an industrial spec microcontroller board from a legitimate and respected supplier, through Farnell, and it had a counterfeit FTDI chip on it.I built that board into a piece of test equipment that s likely to be used for 5 or 10 years. Fortunately this whole saga happened while I was still developing it - if their chip bricking driver had been released a year later, I d probably not have known about it. Someone would connect the test PC to Windows Update in 3 years time, and the device would stop working.Counterfeit chips are a reality, and not one that people building devices on a small scale can properly mitigate against. Not buying chips on alibaba is common sense, but not buying pre-built modules from Farnell? If you re not going to buy them from Farnell, where are you going to buy them from?
2024-08-11 12:50:19.000	I like it best when a chapter takes between 10 minutes and a half hour to read through.Textbooks you re surely going to focus on one chapter at at time and you don t want it to take very long to re-read, which most students will likely be doing, especially when you may have hours of problems to solve for a single chapter. You want to be able to re-read without a lengthy commitment compared to the problem-solving.Regular non-fiction may not be as universally re-read but it would be more often than with fiction.With fiction or storytelling a half hour is a good max so there will always be a stopping point within reach, with two chapters not being out of the question lots of times. People may not re-read a fiction chapter as they go along very much, but why not make it easier anyway.Then again people probably like a chapter that takes whole hour or more but is such a page-turner that it seems like a half-hour or less

From everything I ve seen, Chinese propaganda is much more crude and much more official than that. They don t force other people like celebrities what to say, they broadcast via state TV channels and they put up huge banners. They have censorship, which means forbidding certain things, but I ve never seen them coercing celebrities to say things they don t agree with. In general people can choose to stay quiet and not get involved. Do you have evidence that shows that the celebrity statements are coerced? Again this is not criticism, I am truly curious about your sources.From what I understand, nationalism in China is real. Do you perhaps dispute this notion?

The truth is for the longest time Linux geeks have been speaking the parlance of technology. In this article I see things like this. a better ISV story Channel issues This is the first step towards actually making inroads. That right there is BS and its the language of the corporate sales cycle. Linux will need advocates who are fluent in the language of the corporation to make the partnerships and sales deals that will be required to get Linux onto the corporate desktop. We are not there yet where we can walk into a sales room and compete on a corporate sales cycle with the professional sales guys who pitch solutions based on Microsoft, but at that point that s the battle that needs to be fought.

I got into the habit of having the lab work done request the script the week before the appointment. That way I wouldn t have double anxiety. Prior to that I d meet with the doctor, he d give me a script and then I d have to wait for him to call with the results. Also found it was helpful to schedule other appointments eye, dental around the same time. Compact all the anxiety into a 2 week period.One thing that is good is my wife is an internal medicine doctor but deals usually with really sick hospital patients. So typically anything that I am concerned about I can just ask her and she can put my mind to ease. So far hah hah .The only upside to the anxiety that I have I wouldn t call it severe but it s noticeable is that I get a definite mood bump right after an appointment when I find nothing is wrong. 1 1 So hey since you don t go every year or more you don t know what you are missing!!!

2022-02-27 15:55:36.000	Russia will never have full air superiority because Stingers .Ukraine s fixed assets were wiped out on day 1, but they have mobile units which I believe are still effective.The lack of use of a lot of air power by Russia in the last few days I believe is due to the fact that on day 1 they had serious damages and it s just very costly out there.Mobile AA units can operate independently but I don know if it s Russian or Western gear, if Russian, it may be hard to replace. Because even free gear from the West right now would require training.But - there is an unlimited supply of Stingers from the West, and those will do serious damage to all helicopters, and seriously risk close air, and also hugely risk transport aircraft on approach.Ukraine can plop a 19 year old anywhere within 3-4K of an aerodrome and pluck transports out of the sky with impunity. So far they ve knocked out 2 transports which is very expensive to the Russians.On day 1 they tried to land airborne using 30 transport helicopters, 3 were taken out, that s devastating. Russians had to follow up with 100 helicopter transport landing at once, to land 1000 soldiers, that is a huge portion of their rotary wing assault fleet for one single operation. Very risky.That said, the Russians are sill flying missions.But yes, it s a huge factor.Ukraine s ability to consistently deny Air Support is 100 a decisive issue. Without it, they d be getting demolished by Russian Airships, much like Iraqi Army facing the US.

The decentralization quality should not be used to describe any system that doesn t exhibit a permanent, irreversible systemic trend towards greater decentralization of all the levers, concentrations and bottlenecks of power within itself over time.For this to happen, the natural tendency toward concentration of leverage would need to introduce a proportional net cost increase to the system, rather than as it normally would be the mechanism by which economies of scale accrue to it.

Nevermind what beauty used to mean, since it s just a cultural artifact of a capitalist white patriarchy, and you don t want to be associated with that, do you?What one considers beautiful stops being an instinctive felt sense coming from within, and becomes just an empty statement used for signaling others how sophisticated class-aware etc you are.It s pure neurosis, and I m not surprised such disembodied people have trouble actually creating beauty.

Rather, students should be taught a great amount more at a younger age. In fact, I think mathematics is probably one of the most essential subjects out there. Unfortunately, the way it is taught now is inefficient and gives it a bad name.The rudimentary basics are important for everyone, and mostly those who will not pursue math-related careers. However, it is the content that is taught after the basics middle school and high school curriculum that could be spent on more advanced areas with less calculation work.I feel embarrassed expressing all of these ideas with little background to support them. I m sure you are a lot more knowledgeable on this subject than I am, so thanks for taking the time to acknowledge to my arguments and discuss them with me.

2022-01-25 22:22:17.000	A few points I d like to make 1. You can t migrate to microservices from a monolith. This is an architectural decision that is made early on. What migrating means here is re-building. Interestingly, migrating from microservices to a monolith is actually much more viable, and often times just means stick everything on one box and talk through function calls or IPC or something instead of HTTP. Don t believe me? See this quote The only ways we could break down our monolith meant that implementing a standard feature would involve updating multiple microservices at the same time. Having each feature requiring different combinations of microservices prevented any microservice from being owned by a single team.Once something is built as one thing, you can t really easily take it apart into many things. 2. Microservices does not mean Kubernetes. The idea that to properly implement microservices, you need to set up a k8s cluster and hire 5 devops guys that keep it running is just flat-out wrong.3. Microservices are antifragile, to use a Talebian term. So I think that this paragraph is actually incorrect This uncertainty made creating microservices more fraught, as we couldn t predict what new links would pop up, even in the short term.A microservice is way easier to change again, if designed properly , than a huge app that shares state all over the place.4. What s the point here? It seems like the decision was hasty and predictably a waste of time. Any CTO architect tech lead worth his or her salt would ve said this is a bad idea to begin with.

I understand they have an existing large client base already and if they wanted to add this to their product list quietly that would be one thing, but why try to turn it into something bigger than it is...?Also, I would say based on what I ve seen that most of the Basecamp clients are somewhat tech smart , meaning they could easily see there is next to no value in this for a price. There are countless free alternatives that anyone with a basic tech smart savvy could figure out. Not to mention a lot of those alternatives would be much more flexible. I ll even go as far to say that the average person like my parents, family, etc. knows about even easier alternatives for free like Google Groups or Facebook Groups. And both of those would include all of the functionality plus more presented by Basecamp Breeze and again, for free .I typically associate 37signals products with intuitiveness and creativity originality, this seems like neither.

2018-01-26 13:01:32.000	If Snowden is telling us that our internet habits are snooped on at a national level, then what makes you believe they didn t already use local connectivity to perform such a thing without the local government s authority? Who says they didn t use private connections without authority? I don t think the government had a monopoly on connectivity then. Why would it be different now no matter who controls what?There is a small city in my area that provides internet service to the citizens living in city limits. At one time, it was twice as cheap as Time Warner Spectrum and had faster speeds with more reliable connections. I am not against government provided internet service so long as it operates like this.The entire situation comes down to how one uses the power they have been given. It is evident that an ex-Verizon lawyer should not be the poster child of the future for obvious reasons. I don t know who he thinks he is fooling with his statements either.

The only disease that runs any real risk of being spread are lice... and there s no need to license that. Licenses don t help prevent that. Nor does anyone need 1400 hours of training to know how to identify them, or how to clean combs and brushes.Sloppy people with licenses will still spread them, careful clean people without licenses will never spread them. Enforce health codes instead of insisting on licenses that just put large barriers of entry in front of people trying to make a living.

2011-10-21 23:58:54.000	This is very interesting, thank you so much for posting. I must say that I cringe when I see Low numbers were discarded because of X in surveys. There is always a reason for X, but if possibilities for X are not determined and justified prior to examining the data, then we are cherry picking. I am glad though that the elimination of numbers was at least disclosed. People graduating with a degree from Stanford can be presumed to look for full time work at a salary sufficient to pay off student loans and live in a reasonable shelter and buy food and health care. Earning less than a restaurant manager as an intern is not what people choose, it s what they take when there are no better options. Discarding it as invalid salary information is not well justified ex post facto. If we decide in advance of gathering data to discard people doing internships because these are unfavorable situations and not average ones, why not also discard all the favorable situations that are not average ones as well, such as high salaries received in offers where the student has a relative or friend who helped him find an especially favorable position. Or any other arbitrary criteria chosen after the fact upon examination of the data.
2016-07-15 00:03:33.000	Do you think the income stagnation is due to housing costs rather than globalization?I m not denying globalization s role. However, as bufordsharkley said in a sibling comment, housing costs often do prevent people from moving for work opportunities. They deprive the companies of potential hires and are a significant opportunity cost for the individual. In aggregate this might have an effect. Plus, long-term stagnating income is painful per se, but it s only disastrous when core expenses rise at the same time. with increasing urbanization the costs of housing was rising dramatically as currently people prefer the dense urban areas of a city to its cheaper suburbia I m not american so the phenomenon must be different to me. I think most people end up paying too much for housing, relative to their income. Fortunate and less fortunate people alike spend 35-50 , it s just that some end up in a dump far away from anything incl. their workplace while others have a proper flat in the city.Also, it might be interesting to look at the problem from an age perspective. Retirees except the wealthiest ones probably don t expect to see their incomes rise much, and as a group they re more likely to live in cheap places in the countryside. Younger, working-age people feel the housing pressure, need income to relieve it, and are facing dwindling opportunities for upward mobility.

At least in the case that the OP was taking about -- third-party Facebook clients -- I don t think it would destroy their walled garden any more than third-party Twitter clients did back when those were meaningfully a thing. Standardized APIs aimed at enabling full-featured third-party social network clients wouldn t really contribute to a robust market in competing social networks they d just contribute to a robust market in, well, third-party social network clients.What it seems to me you want is a couple steps beyond data portability, which honestly really isn t enough on its own. What I actually need is a way to import the user s social graph from Facebook or Twitter. That s arguably how Instagram bootstrapped its success initially if you gave it your Twitter account, it would download all your followers following info. And, of course, that s why Twitter shut down that API after that. But doesn t that violate GDPR? someone is raising their hand to say, and yes. GDPR as written does help protect privacy, but it s also an incredible boon to social network incumbents it under it, your social graph can t be treated as your data, because by definition it contains personally identifiable information about all your contacts. For your regulation idea to be meaningful, GDPR and similar privacy regulation around the world would have to be overhauled -- if all the open API can do is import export my personal data sans social graph, it becomes little more than a backup mechanism and a convenient way to fill out registration forms.

2016-12-20 15:19:08.000	More like 35K-50K for teachers here in their early to mid 30s. Mid-sized midwestern city, so the cost of housing is low, but that s still not great, especially considering that you need advanced degrees to approach the top end of that range.Compensation varies greatly by district typically the worst districts pay the best, but they re still undesirable for teachers because the conditions are terrible being cursed at and threatened daily by 5th graders no joke and witnessing assaults gets old fast. EDIT I should add that their healthcare plans tend to suck and are totally useless 1.5-2x as expensive as other options for covering one s family, but the retirement s good. They re also better for people planning to take maternity paternity leave than probably any other employer in the area, especially if you time it so your leave rolls over into Summer and are willing to be docked a couple weeks pay you can achieve near-parity with lower end of normal for parental leave in other OECD states that way!

It s hard to see how a system built on consumerism is not in trouble when our products must be subsidized to compete on exports ag , the population is mostly stagnate, and a large portion of the population is either not working or is making just enough to survive.

2015-03-02 19:35:51.000	This is a terrible, inaccurate article to link. Google Talk is going away, so is irrelevant. Google has a big banner on pages about it that it is going away. I don t even understand why the article talks about it so much and mentions it can still be used inter-server without SSL. That s just silly and clouding the issue. Google Talk is irrelevant to anyone now.Google Hangouts will only show Google people as someone you can message. Period. There are some vague little interop features left. You can login direct to Google servers and chat with a third party client, yes.Google has officially said they will no longer support federation - so other companies Jabber servers and user accounts will not work with Hangout users. So of the two huge user side things everyone is talking about choose non-Google clients and login directly to Google still has some support, choose non-Google account is going the way of the dodo very much so.The article, I guess, only really cares about XMPP like caring about do developers still use Java . The point it makes isn t really the end user sort of thing people are talking about. Google could still use XMPP internally and the article would be screaming yes, but it could be irrelevant to users if there s no interop anyway.

Assuming they re each consuming at half their max TDP, that s around 6 kilowatts.

That s an entire high-end laptop battery, or enough power to move a Tesla half a mile.OpenAI probably have some magic to batch requests under high load but still, pretty power hungry. A good amount of the 0.06 1k tokens they charge is probably just to cover electricity.

2015-12-31 18:55:56.000	I actually like this, and had decided that single quotes were a good digit separator even before C adopted it. I had a calculator, an HP, I think, that used single quotes as digit separators in the LCD display. There is actually a locale that uses single quotes de_CH, the Swiss High German locale. There are no locales that use underscore as far as I know. I have a few aliases like this alias dfk LC_NUMERIC de_CH df --block-size 1024 alias duk LC_NUMERIC de_CH du --block-size 1024 that help me when something like du -h won t do.Also, the underscore is used to separate words in variable names, where it is significant. int my_long_var_name, mylongvarname are different variables. But in numeric constants, the underscore has no meaning. 186_282.397 and 186282.397 would be the same number. This is inconsistent.Finally, in a variable width font, the single quote is much less visually intrusive than the underscore, which tends to be a wide character.I would like to see this form used universally. In my wildest fantasies, I d also allow either . or , as the decimal indicator. That would make some of my European friends happy.

2020-07-19 22:08:39.000	AI can be very useful in practice for theorem proving WITHOUT proving big new theorems or inventing new mathematics. Right now, what makes theorem proving an extremely expensive undertaking is making proof search work. AI could help immensely by improving the search.The process of proving things in provers like Lean, HOL or Coq is interactive roughly, the theorem you want to prove is your starting goal, and you apply tactics to transform the proof goal until the goal becomes the boolean value true. The Platonic ideal of this process is that you provide the main, creative steps of the goal transformation, and the tactics discharge the rest automatically. In practice, however, for the process to work, you need to carefully state your theorems in a certain way, and you need an enormous amount of tacit knowledge about how the internals of the tactics, as well as of the libraries of already proved facts that you can use. These things take years of practice to build up. I think it unlikely that theorem provers will see a significant uptake until the tactics i.e., proof search improve massively.This is where I hope AI could step in. There are many challenges, obviously. The training data sets are relatively modest when I looked a few years ago, the publicly available Isabelle theories, for example, amounted to a few hundred thousand proved theorems, which is a minuscule corpus compared to what something like GPT-3 uses. Then, how do you represent the input, just characters, or do you need more structure? Can you can leverage something like reinforcement learning? How do you could set the training process up? On the other hand, compared to chat bots, the quality of the resulting AI system would be much easier to quantify success rate on a benchmark of new theorems .There s already work in this area, but I m not aware of any grand successes yet. I hope to see much more work on this in the near future. I ve been dabbling in it myself a while ago while I was still in academia, but other priorities have taken precedence in the past couple of years.

2014-11-25 11:36:42.000	I would put Germany in the largely monolingual block they also dub their movies, perhaps uncoincidentally . In my experience they have nowhere near the level of multilingualism as Switzerland or the Nordic countries. You can go to any random Danish town and speak English, and it s a requirement for many jobs that you be fluent in both Danish and English, with extra points for speaking a third language e.g. everyone in the civil service, hospitals, etc. is multilingual . But in most of Germany people are functionally monolingual, at least when it comes to conversations. They may have studied French or English in school, but they cannot carry on a conversation in those languages. The main exception is educated professionals in major cities. And even among those it s spotty many doctors in hospitals cannot effectively communicate with patients in any language but German, and the civil service almost never can. Younger people are more likely to be at least bilingual, though a 30-year-old doctor is more likely to speak English than a 50-year-old one.

It said something along the lines of I don t get why Tesla would kill their battery-swapping while they are tackling other Hard Problems.The practicality of battery swapping decreases exponentially as size and weight scale. The cost of building a battery swapping network for western-car-sized battery systems, even once solving the engineering elements which are manageable , are likely a non-starter. Especially if the other principle technology rival is fast-charging stations.How much added convenience is required to justify huge mechanical systems with many wear components and large maintenance costs over replacing a few charging cables every X months? Lots.
2012-07-19 16:55:14.000	IANAL, but I believe that prior art can still kill a patent. The patented stuff is still supposed to be the inventor s original work. The patent office may not be terribly diligent about searching for prior art, and establishing prior art can still be a massively expensive pain in the ass... but that s another rant. What first-to-file certainly did change is what happens when two claimants try to file a patent on something that wasn t prior art. It used to be that the patent office looked through the inventors records to try to establish who was the first to invent the non-public technology now, it s just the one who was first with the patent office paperwork.

To be fair, I picked the most optimistic efficiency I could find for a coal plant. I was trying to present a best-case scenario.It looks like the best case with natural gas is 60 , or 35 total system efficiency. Yes, that s a significant gain over 26 , but it s a best-case scenario. The real-world efficiency of the most efficient internal combustion cars is fairly similar to that of electric cars.

React_on_rails makes react really nice with rails for universal rendering.It seems a pretty great framework similar to rails could be assembled out of typescript, next.js, react, typeorm, webpack, ant design, terraform, postgres, cloudflare workers, cloudflare key value store, rds and by adding model and view generators, plus project and crud scaffolds.
2016-10-02 16:50:00.000	No, just no. Nokia did fail because they chose an OS that failed. They bet everything on Windows Mobile and lost.You can t say with a straight face that if they choose Android instead that they would be in the same situation. Nokia could ve had pro quality cameras that happen to be phones out long before any of the other Android phone makers.They blew it. Partnering with Microsoft was a huge mistake.
2010-04-20 19:57:30.000	Not any other investment, by a long shot. Because while there is a potential benefit to government assistance, there are also potential costs in terms of distorting markets, inefficient allocation, and creating oversupply. There is a trade-off, and finding the right one can be difficult.That said, historically we ve gotten surprisingly good returns from subsidies on research, transportation, and certain areas of telecom. The early Internet is a shining example. However a certain amount of caution needs to be maintained because once a precedent has been set then regulatory capture sets in and the long term result of those unintended consequences tends to be very bad.

I see serious media criticism, commentary on the perspective of black Americans facing the threat of police brutality, lighthearted media criticism parody, music and music history analysis, behind-the-scenes looks at a variety of unfamiliar professions, and so much more.And this studio seems to produce high-effort, low-impact content pointing out that Google isn t incentivized to tell children they ve drawn penises or that people like popping balloons.The victimhood complex is a tired look, the studio should try putting their content on TikTok, the artistic constraints might help them be more creative and original.
2021-02-05 19:31:37.000	There are a range of ballistic trajectories that can work. If you want to get there faster, you can use a shallower trajectory they usually call this a depressed trajectory . This takes more energy, so you get a shorter range for a given missile. The other problem is that the warhead spends more time in the atmosphere.Most ballistic missiles use unguided reentry vehicles, so the best accuracy comes from a high trajectory that comes almost straight down onto the target, so it spends the least time interacting with the unpredictable atmosphere.However, if the reentry vehicle is guided, depressed trajectories become more practical. The U.S. did this in the past with the Pershing II, which had terminal radar guidance, and we have a half-way version of this with path length fusing on the Trident II, where the warhead is not guided, but the detonation point is controlled based on trajectory error.Russia has tested these in the past few years and could have deployed them. IMO it s an underappreciated threat because it could allow attacks against hard targets with less than 10 minutes of warning.

Tools like AltStore and ReProvision are the standard for sideloading and renewing respectively legitimate jailbreak-entrypoint apps for un-jailbroken devices there are entire alternative ecosystems based around sideloading modded pirated apps. They are obviously full of pirated stuff, usually work by abusing an enterprise cert from an endless list of Chinese companies not insinuating anything bad, just firsthand experience , and they probably have some nasty malware mixed in here and there as well.

Since 2 3 of their business is in Asia it doesn t make as much difference if London is in the EU or not compared to many other banks.What HSBC have said is that they may move about 1,000 jobs to Paris. That s because those jobs are tied to services that by law must be provided within the EU legal and regulatory environment. When London leaves that environment those jobs will go, not just at HSBC but across our financial sector. See my other larger post on this page for further details.

But if they where lost then it s a 6.0B commodity.It might just qualify as part of the S P 500, but that s not really a major hurdle.PS If bitcoin wants to be a stable currency it may be well served by invalidating any wallet without transactions for a long enough period of time aka 10 years. Otherwise, in the long term there is going to be a lot of possibly dead coins which makes reasoning about the market difficult.

On the other side were the anti-Dreyfusards who deified unreason, convinced that France s identity was rooted in la terre et les morts the soil and the generations of dead buried in it.
2024-07-24 15:11:35.000	Depends how embedded and how many servers it s talking to. I m also not sure you can really tolerate false positives, since the main domain you talk to might get revoked, but there are alternatives to Bloom filters that eliminate those. In any case it s going to be hard to go below about 0.8-1 byte per revoked cert common case where most certs aren t revoked even with a fancy data structure.You will surely want to shard the CRL, so if the device only accesses a few servers and thus only has a few shards then it ll be fine, but if it accesses many servers then there will be trouble, and you ll want to reserve extra space in case of a mass revocation.

Since then, Hooks have made anonymous inline functions even more popular.Isn t this missing the point? It s not about the overhead of declaring a new function, it s that you ve made one of the props change on every render, so your child element needs to run its render function every time. The render function of Number only has to create a single H1 element which doesn t seem like a good test.And the ExpensiveComponent example is strange to me. It s being memoized, so what exactly is the point?

The closest bus stop should also rarely be farther away than about 150m.Wheelchairs and electric scooters are used almost exclusively by paraplegics, not by, say, elderly people with arthritis. Having far lower obesity rates compared to the US helps.My impression is that car ownership is exceedingly rare among the elderly, below the already low 30 of households owning cars.But these pedestrian areas don t make too much of a difference they tend to be just single streets, so you can always park on the parallel streets and walk just one block.

I m bipolar, type 1. I think I may know what you re going through.Realize that life doesn t have to be this way and that there are things that you can do to make it better. Realize that you re not able to make full use of your intelligence in the state you re in. You need help making choices and analyzing your situation. Professional help.Talking to a psychologist and being treated by a psychiatrist turned my life around. Again, I m bipolar, so my condition may be more permanent than yours. Remember, taking medication isn t a sign of weakness. Many people only need to take it to get out of their current rut and then cast it off as soon as they see the light of day. I was against taking medication for a long time. But then I realized that brain tissue can be diseased just as any other bodily tissue can be diseased.Something else that helps is to interact with your loved ones more friends, family, anyone who you love and who loves you too. Talk to them. Let them know what s going on in your life. If you don t have anyone like this in your life, I m sorry. This may be contributing to your suicidal thoughts.As others have said, a good diet, exercise, vitamins, and plenty of fresh air and sunshine go a long way.These are things that will help long term and will probably keep you from returning to this state. But, first, you need radical intervention.Make an appointment with a therapist. Today. Be completely open with them. Do as they say. Don t think you re smarter than they are. Remember, right now you re not capable of using your mind to its full capacity. You re sick. Let a professional help you. Right away.
2019-02-23 08:06:43.000	Summary . Never consider data in a process to be confidential if you have evil code in the same process even if it is in a virtual machine or interpreted .It doesn t actually seem too big a limitation. Apart from JavaScript, EBPF, postscript, etc. there aren t that many places that potentially evil code is run alongside confidential data.All those now have to be split out into separate worker processes to be secure. The worker processes can have partially shared address spaces through memory mapping, letting the programmer decide what will be shared with the untrusted code.

2022-02-13 14:27:21.000	I agree on the subtlety. Personally I think that expressing the most miniscule thought about having a lawyer should trigger that process. In practice, the judiciary system has ruled that requests for legal counsel must be unambiguous in the wording used. At a very minimum there should be something like a Miranda warning that does not allow police to continue without-- at each stage the word lawyer is said-- asking are you asserting your 6th amendment right to legals counsel? Please answer with a Yes No. That s off the top of my head though, maybe there s a better way
2023-11-13 16:52:32.000	I ve wondered about this for years.Express was the default with Node for some years but it was mostly used for APIs to feed front ends. These days lots of people have switched to Fastify but again mostly for APIs.There s really nothing fullstack in the JS world that can be compared to Rails, Laravel, or Django.Current fullstack solutions Next, Nuxt, SvelteKit, etc in JS are trying to kludge front end components into the server which IMO is a mistake. And I say this as someone who has been doing mostly front end since the 90s.

That s why I ve spent the past couple of years building a replacement 1 , 2 , and an RPC layer and service selection mechanism that I haven t spec d out yet.We need a binary encoding because they re more efficient in code, time, and power. But we also need a text encoding because we re humans, and eyeballing binary data is terrible. I ve made them both 3 4 , and they re 100 type compatible. The idea is that machines communicate using binary, and translate to from text only when a human needs to inspect it or modify it.The thing slowing me down atm is the coding side of things 5 6 7 8 because it s tricky getting go to play ball with its reflect mechanism. Once I have a functioning gob replacement, I can move up to the next layer.I m probably a month away from releasing v1.0 of CBE and CTE, after which it ll be another few months for Streamux, and then the layers on top of that should go pretty quickly because I m not bit bashing anymore. 1
2012-08-21 15:37:07.000	The comparison you draw is intellectually dishonest.Many of the articles submitted to HN that frame programming as a craft get a lot of support. And just as traditional crafts are taught through apprenticeships, I believe that the same holds true for programming. Software shops can easily find a place for enthusiastic candidates with aptitude and commitment as demonstrated by the OP . There are plenty of tasks that the new apprentice could help with until fully trained. This is how bricklayers a fairer comparison than brain surgeon, you ll agree are trained, and you don t see many houses falling down.

2020-01-18 22:11:25.000	What s it build exactly?For libraries, it builds an output with a concatenated FASL for all inputs which reference the sources by their exact hash in the Nix store, which means that they will be distributed alongside .For programs, it dumps an executable image save-lisp-and-die with executable t .For buildLisp.sbclWith it creates an SBCL that loads an image pre-loaded with all the dependencies. Why would I use this over, say, Quicklisp?Quicklisp is one small bit of the puzzle the distribution of packages using ASDF .Using Nix for the task replaces Quicklisp, ASDF, your distribution package manager used to install your Lisp, your distribution package manager used to install native dependencies of your Lisp code e.g. cl ssl with openssl 0 , your deployment tooling and generally your entire software packaging and distribution stack which leaves you with one homogeneous system that is easily composed across language boundaries. why do you need to specify all the .lisp files in the build ? file?I modeled this after the way Bazel rules are normally written, where specifying each source file is common. In fact, ASDF does this too. 0

Combine this with the fact that they at the time had a large and seeming solid web and software side business it made sense to focus on that and simply drop the hardware, instead of trying to go head to head with Dell HP IBM.

2020-10-25 15:47:56.000	I think there are two ways to manage these types of issues.1. Bring it fully legal and have a large impact on how it is done in cooperation with government. It could be beneficial to allow government insight so that it can prepare the general public about what is going on or how society might reflect on it. In general I believe we should be aware of all of the things this data can do. If during full disclosure people want this data regulated so be it.2. Criminalize it hard mode . It looks like with GDPR it will be criminalized and it will rely on companies using good faith on acquiring data like this. It will be regularly impossible to defeat all criminal actions but there will be no question who has the athority on such measures.With regards to both methods i see huge problems in the public understanding who is using and how the information is used. So it seems for now there is a few options left. One of which is to restrict knowledge and keep good people in power with the opportunity to use this data. Even with that we fail daily.everything is a struggle but perhaps this issue might shape how humans interact with eachother in the future the most.

2019-04-29 07:44:40.000	I get reminded of the situation of domestic violence. Both men and women self-report the same amount of being victims, but women uses less lethal violence and thus die more from domestic violence compared to men.The method matter when it comes to outcomes. With suicide it means men die more, with domestic violence it mean women die more.Addressing the misery that causes people to cause violence against themselves or others is a good idea. What ever priority we want to use for one is likely a good choice for the other.

2021-10-11 16:49:47.000	The best case scenario for an operational failure is the loss of a single AZ, but many of the scenarios you described are things that could impact an entire cloud vendor simultaneously. As others have pointed out in discussing the Carrington event and the recent Facebook outage , it s not a matter of if it will happen, but a matter of when. And then it s just a question of duration and scope of the impact.At this point around half of the world s leasable compute is concentrated in fewer than 100 facilities, the locations of which can easily be found with a google search. Using public satellite imagery you can identify network connection points as well as follow power transmission lines. In a wartime scenario, these are industrial targets with astounding strategic value, a tiny geographic footprint, and limited collateral damage in terms of human life. The Nagasaki and Hiroshima of the future could simply be kinetic attacks against a couple of datacenters. I m alarmed that nobody is prepared for this and the industry zeitgeist seems to be to continue the consolidation of our economies into the cloud.

2019-08-23 09:05:04.000	It isn t when it s commoditized.I have 4 or 5 grocery stores within a short walking distance of me right now. I can buy roughly the same stuff in all of them. I usually go to whichever is cheapest for the stuff I want to buy. They differ in sizes, so they don t stock all the same things, but there s nothing stopping any of them to sell any of the products the others do. This is how healthy competition works.
2013-01-07 02:42:25.000	I don t know enough about the English power market to draw comparisons, but I ll outline a little bit about how the Australian NEM National Energy Market works and how it deals with situations like this. My understanding is derived primarily from an old house mate who did his electrical engineering honours around the NEM.A while back the various disparate energy grids in Australia were more-or-less unified into one big grid well, a few small grids with intercouples , the NEM was established, and the newly formed company NEMCO tasked to govern it.The NEM is a bidding market, where various energy providers and interestingly consumers, more on this later provide bids detailing how much energy they are willing to provide and at what cost. These bids are placed, I believe, at least one day in advance though they can be revised after being placed.If a providers bid is successful, its output gets adjusted automatically by the NEM to fulfil the quota allocated to it note NEM is used to describe both the market and the computer system that manages it, as far as I can tell . The providers will be paid whatever the current spot-price is, regardless of the original bid price.The spot-price is determined by, essentially, greedily consuming the cheapest energy possible until demand is met. Demand is met when the frequency lies within an acceptable bracket around 50Hz . So a coal power station with high base-load capacity will place low bids for the majority of its capacity, to ensure that it gets picked first when demand is being met. It costs a lot of money to turn a station like that off, so they price their bids accordingly. Gas turbine engines have extremely low start and stop costs but their operating costs are significantly higher. These turbines will price themselves so that they get turned on only when demand is high and the spot-price has increased accordingly.During some heatwaves in the summer the spot-price can increase to thousands of dollars per megawatt hour and it is extremely profitable to have a diesel generator hooked up to the grid to take advantage of precisely these situations.I mentioned before that some consumers will place bids. The realities of power generation mean that a station shutting down can be a long and expensive process. They need to ensure that someone is buying their electricity so that that doesn t happen. Typically this comes in the form of a brokered agreement with a large consumer, such as an aluminium smelter. The smelter agrees to buy a large amount of energy at a certain price the details are a bit fuzzy to me and the station ensures that they never drop below minimum load. The thing is, there is a point where the difference between the spot-price on the market and the brokered purchase price is larger than the value of the aluminium that can be smelted with that energy. When this happens, the smelter shuts down its smelting operations and sells the energy back to the market instead.Now its not so simple as the greedy algorithm I outlined before, for precisely the same reasons as brokered deals happen - physical and political constraints. It s an incredibly complex job to schedule power station ramp-ups and ramp-downs while still balancing the load, but for the most part it s handled by the NEM. It takes into account renewable energy quotas what my house mates thesis was on , maintenance shut-downs, water supply for hydro stations and much more.One thing in particular that I found interesting was the cost of transporting the energy. There might be tariffs on intercouples between states, but the main cost is actually the distance the energy has to travel. You can t simply turn a coal power station up when a town in the middle of the desert has a power spike, as the attenuation between those two points well, the closest station that has excess capacity as a result of the increase means the demand isn t met. Instead, a diesel generator near the town might need to be turned on, which can be very expensive. The grid has a number of way to mitigate issues like this, but it s still very interesting.The point is, a well written system makes this market work efficiently, but the domain of the problem is still huge. The mostly free market takes care of many of the load balancing issues, however human intervention seems unavoidable because there are simply so many things that can go wrong. Edit NEMCO is now called the Australian Energy Market Operator AEMO and their website is at 0 . It has lots of good stuff to look at for the interested. In particular 1 has lots of nice details about the history and structure of the Australian Energy Markets. 0

2020-02-04 15:20:32.000	I m not saying let s just despair and do nothing , of course we should focus resources on innovation. In fact that s what we re doing right now. But let s not focus _all_ of our resources on a hope.Don t you think it s safe to assume that technologies might not save us and that we should work on some alternatives, just in case the first scenario doesn t work? collapse comes from a lack of ingenuity, a sclerotic loss of the ability for a society to solve problems.So you re saying that the _only_ way of preventing collapse is by technological advance? And that we should not try to make sociaty sustainable without growth, or at least to do some reasearch on how that might be possible?
2018-02-22 15:55:48.000	I have yet to see a convincing argument that proof-of-stake can be made trustless.It turns out that trustless is more subtle and not quite as discrete as we might ve thought. While PoW coins like Bitcoin are probably ranked higher on this scale than others, it might not matter. That s not to say that trustless consensus is necessary for a currency.Agreed. IMO these newer coins that are lower on the trustless scale would not have been possible without the high bar that Bitcoin set. But now, they are.

2017-11-14 15:39:55.000	If we didn t prevent it, then you d be stupid to not go to college take out 120k in loans and then declare bankruptcy at 22 prior to taking a job Yeah, but that s exactly why no one would ever lend that amount in the first place. That, I believe, was the OP s point. College should not cost what it does. And part of that reason is federal guarantees upon the debt. So colleges can raise the price and since the debt is guaranteed creditors are happy to lend. Essentially, there is no check and balance on the price of education that exists for pretty much everything else that might be financed i.e. a car . IMO the only way to solve it is to put the school on the hook for part of the if the default rate exceeds X . Totally disagree. That seems to violate every notion of contract law that exists. The colleges are not taking part in the loan process. They are not agreeing to take any monetary risk on the individual. They are simply offering a service at a bloated price. The debtor agrees to take on debt to pay for the service and the creditor agrees to take the risk. The college should not be brought into that totally separate contractual agreement. That s like holding an employer responsible for debts that an employee defaults upon because the employer had cutbacks and laid off the employee.

At worst it becomes an exercise in catering to someone s pride in being more woke than those other dullards.Robert Greene really hammered the point home in his opus The Laws of Human Nature . People, all of us, need to cater to our vanity.

I realized the power of psychedelics, and needed help to figure out their real power .They just sort of boil everything off. You get down to the core of who you are, and realize that the anxiety you feel is either completely irrelevant and useless, or based on something you absolutely have control over.The first time I tried both of them not at the same time, obviously was in my late 20 s.

If you can kill all the taxis and discourage private vehicle ownership because you control Ubering , there will be a profound cultural habit to use YOU, Uber , rather than some slightly cheaper replacement.I don t know if it s worth as many billions as it s cost so far, but it s not nothing. This is being done because a monopoly of this type is NOT so easily busted by some bright spark disruptor . If nothing else, you can spend a few more billions buying whispering campaigns suggesting that the new disruptor is unsafe or tainted, or simply attack them more directly, terrorize their drivers, whatever.Even without such black tactics the notion of frictionless liquidity in market dynamics is foolish. It doesn t work that way.

It s ok and normal that the expectation in some countries including the United States is that people are more individualistic and that nuclear families tend to be the norm.I d argue that the problem that s evading us here isn t solved by increases in communal living although boarding houses and single-unit apartments with common spaces could help - but good luck enforcing cleanliness standards since we re a bunch of animals , but instead is solved by building with appropriate levels of density such that regardless of your living arrangement preferences you can still live near enough other people, restaurants, doctors offices, work, etc. and activities that are appropriate for the stage of life you are in.If you are single you might be renting or living in a small studio apartment. You don t have to hate living alone when you don t have to spend all day cooped up unless you want to drive 15 miles to participate in society. You can walk out your front door.The married and obviously wealthy couple can invite the neighbors over for a BBQ and to hang out by the pool. But you can t do that really in the suburbs.The four Catholic girls can still live in their long house and probably have an easier time participating in local charity or prayer events since they don t have to drive to go participate in those activities and make them a chore.Etc.
2016-03-29 19:46:56.000	Does the classic wear funky makeup to fool face recognition even work with recent deep learning advances? I d doubt it s nearly as effective.If you re referring to the recent deep learning classifies this random noise as a dog news, keep in mind that humans are far more suited to more abstract tricks like wearing makeup than learning the perfect static to fool an image recognition algorithm. Even with computer assistance and access to AlphaGo in order to train the perfect pathological boards, the high branching factor of go makes it impossible to for a human to remember what the relevant pathological board would be halfway through the game. Also, keep in mind that the adversarial reinforcement learning is essentially training against as many pathological boards as possible. Image recognition isn t trained this way. So I don t think you re right about this. I feel like the era of makeup tricks is finished though maybe there s still one or two wins left from this approach . If Lee beats AlphaGo, I think it s because their strengths are truly similar.
2023-03-04 21:58:32.000	When the advice hinges on a unique set of circumstances that you can t reproduce, then they are likely giving you their lottery ticket.People typically don t explain their success with just after I opened the pickaxe shop, the gold rush started . Even if that is a major factor in their success, they will explain their success coming from other factors, like waking up at 5 am to listed to podcasts while running on the treadmill. The advice that you should wake up at 5 am and listen to podcasts on the treadmill is reproducible, but timing the pickaxe shop opening with the gold rush is not reproducible.

What had tended to happen up till then, and indeed what continues to happen, is that academia tries to _explain_ Religion. Religious Studies isn t fundamentally opposed to explaining its subject matter per se. But rather it is more fundamentally concerned with, well, _studying_ Religion. Which of course does mean at least being open to theories, such as the ego one in the article, but ultimately it s primary concern is more to create a dedicated space in which Religion can _present its case on its own terms_. Humanity _needs_ Religious Studies, just because Religion is Seriously Fucked Up , doesn t mean that it doesn t deserve serious academic attention, quite the opposite.So, on the other hand I m a little hesitant about this article, because it is both invoking Religious Studies and trying to explain Religion in the same breath. I actually like the ego-control theory, I have no bones with that. And we were certainly not discouraged from coming up with our own theories at university. But what I took the most inspiration and value from during those undergraduate years was the sheer power of dedicating the entire weight of an academic discipline to the uncompromising _study_ of a subject matter _without_ the explicit agenda of trying to explain it away. Like I said, that does not at all mean that Religious Studios wouldn t welcome an overarching Grand Unified Theory of Religion, it s just to say that, if you learn anything about Religious Studies today, it s that a GUT is way, way down the list of Religious Studies priorities.

2022-10-11 20:13:09.000	The reason marathon runners are so rail-thin is because they run a lot. Running preferentially burns muscle as well due to the quickness of conversion after glucose is gone.I think there s some selection bias to this though. The morbidly obese tend not to be marathon runners, as well as the very muscular. Marathon running is an extreme activity that preferentially self selects certain physical attributes and conditions. This is not to say that a morbidly obese person can t take up marathon running - but they unlikely to be able to maintain it successfully while remaining so.

2023-11-19 07:47:57.000	After covid my trust in future of humanity has plummeted. It feels like every time I see people they re talking about science where they ve actually thrown the science part out and are having a lot of feelings how things are. Apparently everything is impossible to know, even all the things that are extremely well studied and really simple, and you can replace all the modern science by reading some tweets, listening to bro science podcasts and feeling them out, and always ending up the result you were looking for anyways. It s hard to understand how people s understanding of complex subjects can be on so ridiculous level but still be thinking they know everything they need to know. Maybe my view is biased but it s always the same story everywhere I go, though I ve stopped going out as I find it so frustrating and depressing. I even meet people who have been studying science for years but don t really know how scientific method works and obviously don t even know what scientific paper looks like.

If you were to put those 8 people into individual cars, you d make the road a lot more crowded. I think a lot of folks look at these mostly-empty buses and don t realize that most cars are mostly-empty also average 1.5 occupants car in most of the US, honestly probably lower in the LA area due to its sheer car centricity. But of course if you re in a car you re more likely to view another driver as someone like you while you look at the bus and think of it as a waste of space and taxpayer money.

This is particularly the case in a startup.

For comparison, the 747-100 which made its first flight just before Concorde s used perhaps 1.1 times more fuel to cross the Atlantic but carried about 4 times as many passengers.Suborbital space flight means any place on the globe is a 2 hour flight away, but the fuel costs are pretty high.

2014-12-28 13:15:09.000	Yeah - this is a sample of the gold standard of psychology papers, and only 10 13 could be reproduced.Having watched scientists at work, reproducing 10 of 13 high-profile studies sounds pretty reasonable. Given p 0.05, you d expect 19 20 to be reproducible. Then you add in other factors - Surprising positive results get published more readily than negative ones.- Some results may be sensitive to tiny changes in methodology.- And more Why Most Published Research Findings are False of these effects can be reduced with pre-registration of studies, and with other methodological improvements. But in general, even when everybody plays by the rules, a fair bit of garbage is going to slip through, because it s hard to eliminate all sources of error and bias.So when a scientific field can say, Hey, 3 4ths of our really interesting results are real! , that s about what I expect when the processing is working.

They adjusted the proportion of positive emotional expressions and negative emotional expressions in users news feeds in order to test for an association between that proportion and emotional expressions in users posts. There are serious problems with what they did, but intentionally made hundreds of thousands of people fall into a depression is late-Slashdot style trolling.

Doesn t the fact that Apple being the company selling the AirPods for a mighty hefty fee I might add at least suggest the opposite of moot , since they re making a lot of money on new headphones by removing the jack?You can still use any old pair of wired headphones with the free provided adaptor. So the removal doesn t force anyone to buy AirPods -- or any other of the tons of bluetooth headphones.

2018-03-03 15:06:19.000	There s a couple ways to do it, depending on how much you do don t want it to look like WordPress. In both scenarios you have to mentally translate what you want to do into WP architecture e.g. you want a new model? In WP that s a custom post type, etc. .The easier way is to create custom post types for each model you want, and use Advanced Custom Fields plugin for the data fields. Users log into the WP backend and can CRUD the custom post types. With ACF, pretty amazing things are possible inter-model relationships, uploads, etc, and all done with amazing UIs for each type of field .The harder way if you are trying to make your app appear less like WP is to get a plug-in that hijacks the user login process and admin, then customize the front-end to display the CRUD fields controls again using custom post types and ACF when users are logged in, so your users never see the WP admin.Both ways and more, now that WP also has a new-ish full-featured rest API are possible, however the standard WP caveats apply the more plugin-spaghettini you introduce, the more unexpected issues you will face.

It s far easier to urinate in a bottle on the truck and keep moving.I imagine they eat while on the move too.So I m not quite sure this is the indignity you make it or to be.
2021-01-22 23:37:27.000	I filed an issue on the project, Point out the privacy risks of timestamps in object IDs 0 .----Non-random object IDs have privacy issues. Developers need to learn about these before they choose to use non-random IDs over simple random IDs. How about adding a PRIVACY section to the readme?Timeflake encodes the precise time that a user created an object. Timestamps in IDs can reveal User timezone.Geographic location If the client software creates multiple associated IDs at the same time like an article and embedded media , then the differences in timestamps of the IDs can reveal the latency of the client s network connection to the server. This reveals user geographic location. This can also happen if the client creates a single ID and the server adds an additional timestamp to the object.User identity de-anonymizing - Most Android apps include Google s libraries for working with push notifications. And some iOS apps that use Google Cloud services also load the libraries. These Google libraries automatically load Google Analytics 1 which records the names of every screen the users view in the app, and sends them to Google. So Google knows that userN switched from screen New Post to screen Published Post at time K.- Some ISPs record and sell user behavior data. For example, SAP knows 2 that userN made a request to appM s API at time K.- Even if the posting app does not share its user behavior data with third-parties, the user could post and then immediately switch to an app that does share user behavior data. This provides data points like userN stopped using an app that does not record analytics at time K .- Operating Systems Android 3 , Windows 4 , macOS 5 send user behavior data to their respective companies.- Browsers and Browser Extensions send user behavior data to many companies. Data points like userN visited a URL at example.com at time K can end up in many databases and sold.- Posting times combined with traffic analysis can perfectly de-anonymize users.How long the user took to write the post. This can happen if the app creates the ID when the user starts editing the post and also shares a timestamp of the publication or save time.Whether or not the user edited the post after posting it. This can happen if the posts s displayed time doesn t match the timestamp in the ID.Whether or not the user prepared the post in advance and set it to post automatically. If the timestamp is very close to a round numbered time like 21 00 00, it was likely posted automatically. If the posting platform does not provide such functionality, then the user must be using some third-party software or custom software to do it. This information can help de-anonymize the user.---- 0

2020-08-14 20:38:39.000	I was under the impression that the reason more STEM degrees weren t online because you can t effectively replicate science or engineering labs at home very well.True, you can t. But I have a BS degree in physics, and I took a grand total of one physics lab in four years. I also took one in chemistry. True, that s not engineering. But then, most math people don t take many labs at all.So maybe this is true of the TE parts of STEM, and not so true of the SM parts.

2023-03-15 06:52:17.000	Freedom is freedom given to others. Freedom is often misunderstood as personal egoistical freedom, but that is not how it works if you want everyone to be as free as possible. For years I include that this means occupying the least amount of time of others with your own agenda, which clearly includes the usual paid work relationship, but also all sorts of other dependencies, most often artificially created ones to actually limit the freedom, like debt for good education etc. These self-proclaimed free societies we live in are a lot, but free? There is tons of spare room to the top, while the bottom is much closer than many think.

Now that generation is automated via lastpass or bitwarden, there are two standard styles and makes it harder to fingerprint users based on it

And makes both subject to limitations, set out by law freedom of art, for example, is not limited by laws, at least not literally in the text of the constitution .Paragraph 2 lays out one such limitation social benefit.Paragraph 3 lays out a means to achieve that expropriation exceedingly rare, I think it is sometimes used for huge infrastructure projects like Autobahnen or railroad tracks, but only after years of negotiations .So it is indeed a general rule, not a detail to expropriation.To your question about the limits on paragraph 2 let me just throw in a bit from the German Wikipedia, without having checked it Not all property is subject to this limit to the basic right to property, but only such property that has social relevance I would interpret it so that apartments and housing are clearly having social relevance, but your Porsche probably hasn t.Furthermore Those limitations to the basic right to property must be rooted in fomal law, not just regulations or jurisprudence.

Do you attempt to increase your frame rate perception?Do you find normal movies in the theater difficult to watch because of your high frame rate? If I could see gaps in 144 Hz, then it seems totally imagining with math , like it would be the equivalent of a 4 Hz frame rate for normal eyesight. 24 Hz 144 Hz 24 Hz normal movie 4 Hz. 4 Hz looks super choppy bad.

2011-08-01 19:33:49.000	The scripting languages are quite similar. IMHO, it is better to learn something different instead of another one of them.Perl has an emphasis on libraries. CPAN is the gold standard for the scripting languages. To see what I mean -- search for signatures, Moose and Acme Bleach on search.cpan.org. Another good thing is the community of smart and laid back people.I personally prefer to do Perl because it is fun.The main disadvantage with the Perl everything and the kitchen sink attitude is if you are in a group without good coding standards... Perl also gets a tougher learning curve in the beginning, just from there being more to learn. Joke modules on CPAN generally start with Acme.Edit Huh, why down votes?

All the contractor has to do is register an ABN free and can be done online and send you monthly invoices.Also be aware that in Australia people usually pay for their own health insurance if they want private health insurance.Just be careful to set things up so it looks like your contractor is really a contractor.

Even today there s still packages missing binary wheels and compiling other people s code on Windows to build install a package sucks.At another company I ve seen - Each service and internally developed package had its own git repository - Projects used dependency links 1 to get the packages from the gitI didn t like this approach because it split up tasks and created a lot of PRs. In the first setup with a monorepo you could see all the changes in one PR. 1

2021-12-21 18:38:00.000	The US government responded to the 2008 financial crisis with the Dodd-Frank Act of 2008 to protect everyone against the kind of speculation that caused that financial crisis.Much of the financial legislation that regulates banks, payment systems, and other intermediaries is created in response to fraudsters and scammers.There are lots of shock asorbers that you might not be aware of. In the US payments system, a pull-based payment system, when a merchant makes a request to pull funds from your bank account, your bank is liable for the funds if they authorize the transaction. This protects the merchant from not receiving their money. The whole network is filled with debits and credits and liabilities.In fact it already is a distributed system that mirrors the social and political structures of moving value.Another shock absorber is that state chartered banks that handle a certain volume of transactions must first prove they have enough funds in reserve to serve their liabilities. Again to protect consumers.It s quite a fascinating industry and if you want to learn more about it there is an excellent book to get started 0 .However don t take the US system as the ideal model. There are more modern payment networks and protocols that enable transaction settlement in near real-time that is much more convenient and common in places like the EU and Canada. 0

I have an Indian passport and am in an EU country on a work visa for As for immigration, applying for visas for every single thing is not fun at all. Canada gave me a 4 year visa even though my degree is supposed to take 4.5 years, meaning I had to collect all documents again, pay the high fee, and risk getting rejected and not be able to finish my degree for just one semester. The application did not get processed for months after that because the government wanted me to provide biometrics at a government run facility, which was obviously closed because of the pandemic they closed 1 day before I had an appointment booked . It ended up being processed after my original visa expired, which was not a very enjoyable time.US internship visas have restrictions involved saying that I can not go back to the US for full time work without going back to my home country for 2 years. The problem here is I have nowhere to go in my home country anymore.In the past I ve had to withdraw applications for internships in the UK EU as they required travel for onsite interviews and my visa didn t come through on time. Bigger companies so they only had a couple of options for onsite days . At least the companies were nice enough to reimburse the visa fees as they are hundreds of dollars for every single visa.Making plans to go travelling with friends before the pandemic was always difficult as I was the only one would have to obtain a visa and so needed atleast a month of lead up time. Even then it s not guaranteed to come on time so the entire trip would have to be cancelled.Even at the airport, I have been almost refused boarding multiple times despite having all the right documents, because systems don t work perfectly. Usually this is fixed by talking to a supervisor or someone else with more authority, in a couple of cases they called the country s border police to see if I should be let in.

As he and some others mention, if you say that you are with the press or organization X you are much more likely to get to talk to someone who has direct involvement with the congressman i.e. an LA legislative assistant or even chief of staff although he s about as scarce as the congressman at least in my instance. It s unfortunate though that you have to lie to order to get your personal opinion conveyed. I agree that we should have more congresspeople or at least a way to better account for everyone s point of view.
2010-03-19 01:56:58.000	Well, one of the things I don t like about the iPad is that you are limited to the iPad OS, and that it s not a replacement for netbooks no usb or flash . It s the platform of Apple and nothing else. But, I do agree with you that it s really different from a desktop PC and the iPad is really nice for end users. Like they say, it s the best experience for the stuff the iPad is made for.However, Windows has multitouch with the newer versions of .NET. You can also run Flash Flex. I think a Windows alternative would fit enterprises that mostly run on Windows software for paticular uses which is what I intend to build apps for . However, I got no idea if it work on the exo pc tough.

2017-06-04 11:00:48.000	Many of those who insist on Biblical literalism have already read this stuff.I would argue that many likely haven t, or at least not all of it. There are plenty of Christians who construct a coherent narrative of what the Bible says in their heads based on cherry-picking and second-hand interpretation, believing it was inspired, word for word, jot and tittle, Old and New Testaments in whatever form their church currently accepts 0 by God Himself. They re told that Jesus was prophesied about in Daniel, and that certain monsters in Revelation represent Apache helecopters, and that everything makes perfect sense because the dots are connected for them.But if one wants to believe that the world was created in seven literal days, one either has to fudge the definition of days which many do to account for the actual evidence, and come up with some reason for there being two completely different creation accounts in the Bible, or come to terms with the fact that the Bible is a work of fiction written by fallible human beings to understand their world in ways we understand far better now.When I was in Sunday School aeons ago, I certainly had more questions about the Bible than answers, and it eventually became clear that the people teaching me had no greater or more profound insight into the nature of reality than I had. There are bound to be others who will read the Bible and start to have doubts that what s described there represents absolute truth. When you read it yourself, it s incoherent and irrational.But you re right, there are some people you just can t reach. 0 let s just ignore the numerous Biblical canons in existence, or that awkward period when all non-Latin translations were considered heresy, or that other awkward period when there was no singular canon, only numerous oral traditions and Gospels, many of which were decided after the fact to have not been the Word of God after all...

The first time it happened it was what my employer actually wanted... but now I love it and it would be hard to go back.I wish more employers were open to it.I realize not everyone has the luxury to take 80 of the salary they _could_ be making, and still take care of what they consider necessary expenses... but a lot of software engineers do.At this point I don t understand how anyone has the luxury to work 5 days a week and still have enough time to take care of what needs taking care of without going insane!I am fully confident I am a more efficient worker at 4 days than 5, I get done probably 95 of what I would at full time, for 80 of the salary. It s actually a great deal for the employer. I wish employers were universally open to it.

You re usually saying some quite insightful stuff.So let me ask if I may, how could I put forth the idea that colonialism isn t such a bad thing without being inflammatory and libelous? I know a lot of people hate it, are raised and taught in school that their country s revolution was most justified and glorious, etc, etc. I was taught the same way, and had the same feelings until doing a lot of research and reading Now I don t think that s the case, I think the British did a generally good job, and if I was alive in the times of the British Empire, I m pretty sure I d want to be under British rule. Is there a way I can put that point of view out there straightforwardly without tweaking people?

If a parent trusts their kid to have free reign over the internet that s also a choice I imagine that s how many of us were raised, before such filters even existed .

All they have to do is generate 11 billion or more in new tax income sometime in the future for a project like this to be worth it. Alternatively, it has to protect 11 billion worth of national interests.Maintaining and expanding this type of national technology lead is worth way more than 11 billion.

2022-03-22 15:42:47.000	To echo others relatively good performance, incredible tooling deployment infra really best-in-class , intercompatibility with tons of other languages built on top of the JVM such that it can be functional do actors whatever your other weird approach is, relatively high productivity due to a large library base not just the standard library but also a huge amount of stuff written to support android apps , and ease of hiring replacement.But to throw another onto the pile, Java being statically compiled makes it a lot easier to comprehend a larger codebase that you didn t necessarily write yourself. The history of dynamically-typed languages is basically getting to a certain critical size and realizing there s some merit to a well-defined, compiler-checkable code interface and then retconning it in - this happened with Facebook Hack-lang , with Typescript CoffeeScript Google , and I think there s one for Python now too.So yeah, basically people like Java because it s fast and versatile, because it s got a Pythonesque amount of stuff already written for it, and because it s got features that are oriented towards bigger teams with more turnover etc that make it practical for business reasons.
2015-08-23 16:41:46.000	When I studied at HPI I had a course where we would hack on features for the Lively Kernel. I m not sure how far they ve come and if they got the performance problems solved. Lively used to work at halfway acceptable speeds in Chrome and Safari only, but I m not sure if this was because of Webkit or the JavaScript engine. I have to admit, I didn t like it much. I couldn t wrap my brain around why I should create a live coding environment which would be destroyed on a reload. Then it is only used as a fancy REPL.For my day to day programming I prefer regular JavaScript or languages which compile to JavaScript.

2024-10-07 13:15:39.000	This can be surprisingly hard with some frameworks that just assume that you are buffering the entire response in memory. Usually, if you look hard there is a way around this. This is the 1 most common mistake made by a web framework .Before YOU jump up with a list of exceptions, it slowly gets better over time, and it has been getting better for a while, and there are many frameworks in the world, so the list that get it right is quite long. But there s still a lot of frameworks out there that assume this, that consider streaming to be the exception rather than non-streaming being a special case of streaming, and I still see new people make this mistake with some frequency, so the list of frameworks that still incorporate this mistake into their very core is also quite long.My favorite is when I see a new framework sit on top of something like Go that properly streams, and it actively wrecks the underlying streaming capability to turn an HTTP response into a string.Streaming properly is harder in the short term, but writing a framework where all responses are strings becomes harder in the long term. You eventually hit the wall where that is no longer feasible, but then, fixing it becomes very difficult.Simply not sending a content-length is often the right answer. In an API situation, whatever negative consequences there are are fairly muted. The real problem I encounter a lot is when I m streaming out some response from some DB query and I encounter a situation that I would have yielded a 500-type response for after I ve already streamed out some content. It can be helpful to specify in your API that you may both emit content and an error and users need to check both. For instance, in the common case of dumping JSON, you can spec a top-level results ... , error ... as your return type, stream out a results , but if a later error occurs, still return an error later. Arguably suboptimal, but requiring all errors to be known up front in a streaming situation is impossible, so... suboptimal wins over impossible.
2020-08-05 00:46:04.000	I got my startup failure story out of the way in 2000, so I am lucky there. But yes, Agile has some fatigue for some who are tired of the faddishness. Some people find it invigorating, and more power to them.My guess is that tons of these kinds of jobs are out there because the real world still exists and the people in it are often using computers, but perhaps not as centrally to their jobs. However, people like you and I can provide options to them that they did not have before, and sometimes may not have even envisioned. Just as a case in point, this new place was setting up some machines and had a few tedious configuration problems, so I used batch files and a few more things to save them time and add reproducible results. They were shocked but this was stuff for me where I had to dust off things I had forgotten a decade prior.In my previous job, I found areas of satisfaction as I noticed above, and they were all tied to people not users , to physical objects rather than instatiations of some class , and so on. I noticed how much churn there was, how often things would have to be redone not because anything realistic demanded it, but because of style, or some kind of platform migration, or something else End-of-Lifed, and so on. Indeed, constant platform migration made me realize that nomads are not known for their lasting works of architecture.

2021-05-24 07:58:43.000	The main problem is persistent storage . In k8s, a PVC PV is probably close to the right answer, but in general that gives you a file-system view of the storage, not a block-device view, which for some databases might matter .Also, in general, that persistent storage is generally not locally attached, which means that some file system interactions may have unexpected semantics. Now, with a DB, you re probably only going to have the PV attached on a single worker node, so most of that will actually just work.

And you don t even need to change that option to run non-signed apps anyway, since you can always right-click the app and select Open and it will allow you after a warning to launch it anyway even though it is unsigned and IIRC it only warns you for quarantined apps, so once you ve launched it this way you can launch it normally afterwards .

Many people use their brains just fine and have, in fact, experienced violence from those in power.Perhaps they knew or were related to one of the dozens of people murdered by police. Perhaps they were turned away from a favorite recreational activity by armed BLM agents and snipers violently confiscating cattle. Why does the BLM have snipers? Maybe they were affected by government murders at Ruby Ridge, or police peppering of Occupy protesters, or maybe they were attacked by trained dogs near the Dakota pipeline. Maybe their children were threatened when they spoke out about a tax hike to hire more police. Maybe their relative is in lockup for crossing an imaginary line that arbitrarily bounds Arizona. Maybe their property was taken from them because it could generate higher tax revenue if a strip mall were built there instead. Maybe they read about somebody who fled for their life after exposing illegal activity on the part of the government.Maybe it is possible to use your brain and still be wary of the corrupt use of power in today s society.

They wouldnt let them compete at the olympics either.However, if we hypothesize that in similarity how the ancient macedonians started becoming roman and byzantine after, the same way they were actually assimilated into being slavs and mixed with them, because the slavs were in fact very open minded who was a slav and who wasnt, then we could say that the genetic line is there and in fact lots of people in the balkans and anatolia and south italy trace greek heritage.The slavs from russia and ural are very different looking than the balkan slavs. In addition, you dont see many ethnic hungarians that look asian, even though the initial magyars were asian nomads. Same with bulgaria, the bulgars were asian nomads from the steppe, but hardly any ethnic bulgarians look asian. Meaning, the initial conquerors were a minority group being overlords or leaders of a majority local natives, who then got assimilated.The mixing of peoples was there. The genetic trace is there. But the political rhetoric is crazy.

2020-06-13 02:43:08.000	Are there still people now who doubt that it s an official policy at paypal to make money on freezing people s accounts on every pretext?My first experience litigating with paypal actually dates to years right after my secondary, when I was an exchange student in Singapore.I had a paypal registered on my Russian debit card, and used it for trading on ebay.And yes, one nice day I learned that they want me to prove them that I am not Bennie Laden, with each successive document submission being less, and less reasonable, like demanding a notarised bank statement with wording that no sane Russian bank would issue in its right mind.So, I read the contract, and I saw agree to dispute resolution under law of Republic of Singapore, which was a rather weird thing to see on a commercial contract from Paypal Russia LLC.And so, I got the name of the case officer at Paypal, and had a writ of summon delivered to him in person, myself in a few days. There was no way to describe terror on his face. I remember an exchange - Are you that person lawyer? - No, I am that guy They settled on the first hearing.Only few years later, it came to me that they could have buried me with legal fees, even with court fees alone if they ve chosen to continue.

Please understand that Xi does not speak for all Chinese hence the protest and conflict and having an idiom about crushing bones says next to nothing about how a culture or race is.There are plenty of idioms in English about idiots. Does that say anything about English speakers? I highly doubt it.--- Update Pardon my words. I said it too hastily and don t mean to accuse you. I am born in China and have lived 10 years there. I disagree with some of the actions of the current Chinese government but I am also frustrated with people commenting on things without spending enough time to self educate.The link that you have attached seem to be mostly anti-government and IMO provides a very limited view on a very complex problem.

Because it would make phones from 10 years ago also a laptop replacement for some people, e.g. Teenagers who only use a web browser and some social media.The key feature of a laptop is that you are guaranteed that it can do what you want. Even if you haven t thought of it beforehand. For example, a photographer buys an ipad pro. She reasons it should be fine since Adobe photoshop has been deemed worthy by Apple. For the first couple of weeks she is happy but then she wants to do some 3D work in bender. Oops blender isn t available on ipad and there is no way to make it work. Her laptop replacement isn t a laptop replacement at all since now she needs a laptop as well to run blender.For almost every person such a scenario is certain to occur at some point. If Apple markets it as a laptop replacement it should be able to replace a laptop at all times.

2024-02-24 08:35:29.000	I don t know where you re getting that from but it s simply wrong. Testing is quite easy IMO. I ve been working at the same place for almost 10 years and I introduced our testing framework. We have hundreds of thousands of tests. New guys have some trouble to get started, but after a couple of months they re writing tests for our systems like a pro.Most tests are use-case based or written for checking error-handling.Use-case tests are easy to write you don t even need to be a programmer in fact, it s good if use-cases are defined by a Product Owner or Tester , though of course some cases are only known to the programmer as they re the only ones who dive into the details. The programmer should come up with all use-cases the PO missed, of course, and judge whether or not they need to test those too... sometimes it s ok to not test as the cost-benefit is low. Anyway, once you have this use-case based test mentality, it s very easy to write the tests using a proper language to do it is important! Don t use just JUnit if you re doing Java as it will be really tedious to write and you will stop midway - I know, I ve been there... I highly recommend using Spock, though other frameworks to make writing test pleasurable exist .This applies mostly for integration tests . For unit tests, hopefully you don t find them difficult to write?! I find them quite easy to write since I know how to write testable code, which takes a while to learn but once you do, it s really easy.If you have examples of difficult to write tests, I would be curious to see it! Perhaps we can discuss how to make them easy.

2016-08-24 17:59:34.000	I work on a product that does reconciliation for finance that basically means comparing two lists. Each list could have a hundred items, or ten million. When there s that much variance in n, it matters what the O n is for any code that has to touch this data.Worst-case list comparison for two lists of length m and n respectively, is O mn . For 10 million in each list, that s a bigger number than you can reasonably expect to iterate through using brute force. So brute force won t do it is imperative that you understand how everything that touches all the data scales. Not doing obviously stupid shit means understanding the implementation of data structures and how they scale, understanding how nested loops multiply runtime, how recursion levels multiply runtime. It turns out there s actually a 1 1 correspondence between knowing big-Oh and not doing obviously stupid shit.That s why it s one of our in-person coding questions after the candidate has written up a solution to the problem, they need to be able to analyze what they wrote and understand how it scales to different n. If they don t have an intuitive understanding of the performance of code, the chances are they ll do obviously stupid shit. Personally, I learned about big-Oh long before I went to college, and I believe it s probably the single most useful thing to learn in CS, right up there with compiler theory my previous job was a compiler engineer, so I may be biased . With best practices design patterns etc., it s extremely hard to substitute for experience I see juniors misapplying software design concepts on a weekly basis.

However, you can work around it by separating out the machines that runs Oracle into its own groups of physical machines.It does mean that deployment of Oracle software is much more complicated, since you can t use the regular environment. You also need it to be as separate as possible unless you want to have a long discussion with Oracle s lawyers about how to interpret those clauses.

2021-12-12 10:10:21.000	You re basically using two different sides of your brain.The analytical brain needs to juggle complex things, with a stack of size max approx 7, after which most humans struggle.On the other side, the creative side of the brain can think as it works and often talks to itself, listen to conversation, as the motor side of the brain takes more power than the problem solving side.Music can help either sides, to a certain point. E.g. in a loud and annoying open office, music can help zone out. However, in a quiet home, music can become more of a distraction than helping focus.YMMV, this is based on my personal experience of 20 years.

2020-05-14 19:14:50.000	If you are designing a REST interface then I recommend a domain driven design approach. I ve had a fair bit of success with that.I also like to think in terms of denotational semantics which works rather well with REST APIs. The entities represent the domain objects which model what the system does. The state transfer operations become the game between the client and the system. If the domain maps cleanly the client and the server never have to guess or assume the state of the other. You can follow the operations from the URLs HATEOS, etc .What I find happens to some systems where the design is driven by the UI are domain models that span both the client and the server. This leads to routes that fill data for specific UIs, entities that have different representations based on which route they re fetched from, and the dreaded RPC over HTTP, that the OP seems aware of.A lot of this can be avoided if you never intend to expose your REST API to external developers. Just don t have one. Less to worry about.Designing front-to-back that way makes a lot of sense. I just find that if you do that from a UI through a REST API that a lot of teams and developers skip on maintaining the REST conventions and then end up sad when their project becomes difficult to maintain and onboard new developers to.

Silicon-based solar panels are almost entirely recyclable so if they leave any waste, you re doing something horribly wrong , and even if you couldn t use the somewhat problematic aged wind turbine blades in construction materials which to my understanding you actually can , the weight of the global turbine blade waste mass is a tiny fraction of the global mass of other comparable waste plastics, etc. that our civilization is already generating. So holding 100 years of turbine blades or solar panels is an extremely unlikely thing to happen.

You seem to be saying that, since you know how to hack around the bugs, the fact that they re there doesn t really matter! This is not a matter of the fundamental complexity of a language like this, it s a matter of improving a kludgy way of doing things, and therefore lowering the barrier of entry so that my mom, little brother, and girlfriend can learn to code a website without having to know what star-HTML or double-margin-bug means, and I m not really sure why you d be against that. And yes, I know that it is being improved constantly, it s just painfully slow sometimes.And since I m in rant mode now, one of the things I hate about CSS is the box model... the correct one, not the ie6 one. The idea that the width of an element is not actually it s total width on the page including border and padding , but the width of the internal content constantly pisses me off. It may be a good idea in theory, but in reality, when you re laying things out, the width of the content area is almost always far less important than the total width, and I hate having to do arithmetic every time I change padding!
2019-08-05 18:11:20.000	Yep. Some similarity to TFDV too, but the UI here looks to be more or less lifted directly from Trifacta Cloud Dataprep.pro - Trifacta can be slow, and part of that might be the way it stores the data I m assuming js data structures if so Pandas Bamboolib could improve that.con - Trifacta Cloud Dataprep is directly integrated with Cloud Dataflow and can handle jobs that would crash Pandas.

We have that too in our production, although it isn t down to the individualFair, I mean specifically individual user performance tracking has been happening for at least 30 years - because it used to be in a legacy system I used to use. And the time motion based performance management a-la-Amazon has been around at least 15.

If a lawyer is denied entry for some legitimate reason say drunk and belligerent , and they dig up some other unrelated offense to sue about while ignoring the hundreds of other establishments with the same minor offense , then that is retaliation.

It just gave a lot of innuendo to that effect. One doesn t need to read or speak English to take out or put in 39 rows of seats that are all the same...I don t believe that maintenance signed off on a US N-registration aircraft by an FAA-licensed mechanic outside the US is any more likely to be substandard than that done inside the US. There s just too much at stake for the company and inspector and the safety record of N-reg airliners is outstanding.There is a LOT to worry about Central and South American and African Asian airlines. The second two articles focus there, and there is genuine, statistically significant reduction in safety there.The Vanity Fair article made a big deal about FAA licensed vs not, but I don t see that as nearly as big a deal. I no FAA mechanic credentials can do any amount of work on an N-reg airplane provided I m under the effective supervision of an FAA licensed mechanic. I see no reason to think that isn t safe for me and no reason to think it isn t safe for the teams taking out and reinstalling interiors on heavies.

2019-04-08 03:33:39.000	The author does a good job painting propaganda in its awesome and terrible social media incarnation. The analogy between ISIS with the NZ maniac is a bit troublesome however and I ll tell you why. When I served in Afghanistan, as a mere child myself in the very early 2000 s, I saw children in the street if you can call it a street , dirty, unfed, walking over to a dirty stream washing what appeared to be glass out of the smallest one s foot - all in a town destroyed by whatever. Those children are adults now, how can I blame them for the hatred they must carry around. The western world created the hatred that is was ISIS, in the name of big oil. And we were warned of the consequence before stepping a figurative foot in the middle east. The Christchurch shooter, I don t know his story, but I m sure his hatred didn t come from seeing an occupying force s unmanned aerial vehicle kill his loved ones at the tender age of 4. The NZ shooter s madness and the madness of ISIS are not the same. So My advice to the author is next time you want to preface 4 paragraphs of ISIS talk with a sentence about the a white supremacist to make yourself look less biased, remember that audiences are waking up to the theme of your article - propaganda.

In practice you will discover that async is a bit different. E.g. you can t have recursive functions, some new lifetime effects will come into play an async fn returns a Future, and everything that generated Future captures lifetimes of other things .async await made async programming in rust definitely a lot more accessible! But at some times the lower layers still leak through and cause some unexpected compilation errors.

I don t want to have to login with facebook at all. .and then his reply,Then use one of the other implementations. The problem is it being facebook, not the concept.It s basically anti-Facebook login sentiment to me. Fine, I respect that. But,If you use facebook login for your site then you are shooting yourself in the foot if you care about users.You can t shoot yourself in the foot if your audience of your service can choose. As I said before, people who only offer FB as a login sign up option is not FB s fault. In fact, any websites that don t offer the vanilla username passwrod signup login mechanism isn t FB s fault. So don t mix that issue in any discussion related to FB s new login mode here.Now moving to yours We are hoping they choose not to use the platform _exclusively_ or as a substitute for their own login.I will take it as you don t want to use any website not providing the vanilla username password signup-login, right?So again this has NOTHING to do with FB and its news announcement.the product we re talking about is offered as an alternative to the real thing Facebook Connect and it is what a developer would consider using to avoid writing their own login system.I am confused here. Do you like FB connect and like it over anyone s custom login system?What exactly do you and parent want from Facebook s login and from app developers?
2023-08-27 06:44:18.000	Very well put. I have tried to argue the same point here and on reddit in past. The only real argument against I get is from the privacy perspective. That people tend to use alternative youtube clients or other such hacks to be able to consume ad free content anonymously and with the current state of google are not very keen on providing it with more information about them. Personally I am trying to degooglify my life including working my own open source alternatives for some services I don t find much other good alternatives for- google keep and google books. But my youtube usage pattern being the data shared with google is quite low on the priority list for me but reasonable minds can differ. On the other hand, if enough do start to pay for youtube premium then we would be able to much more fruitfully present our demands including for privacy when we are actual customers and not the product as in the current dynamics.

Be careful as they may work in your browser but not others. Test! - Read JS blogs and watch JS educational videos- PracticeIt s an okay article. If you are clueless how to start learning seriously this should help. Some decent books and websites are mentioned by name.I think the every JS developer needs to learn XYZ is a bit off though.

But if you have only one input, it can t disagree with it self so it s easier to decide.But if the one you have is the one of the two that would be wrong, you haven t gained anything, beside being sure about it while being wrong. At least with two inputs you re able to know something is off. And usually you add more inputs so you can decide, and make a strategy depending on context absolute majority, 50 1, ... .And sorry but if when having multiple input the system is confused, or needs time to correlate all the data, or whatever like that, this is still useful as again it lets you know something is wrong danger will robinson.I think the field of engineering, with planes and spaceships and whatever, has proven how the simplificity advantage of single sensor is a scam that will cost lives to avoid fixing issues.

2024-10-02 00:19:45.000	I think focusing on the timeline is correct though. There is such a thing as pro-social greed, which is to say a desire for a product service company to be long lived through sustainability of their business model. The problem, I think, stems largely from shareholder value theories which force executives to operate solely on a quarterly mindset. When all low hanging fruit in a market has been harvested, those held accountable for value extraction are pushed into short term, unsustainable tactics so that every quarter key metrics can go up regardless of the underlying reality. Hence layoffs and enshittification.

2024-04-03 13:36:24.000	Organizations of all types -- government and otherwise -- are dependent on a wide variety of externally-sourced solutions for mission-critical operations. They can and do develop their own processes for testing and vetting potential solutions against their own criteria for performance, reliability, maintainability, and security.Government orgs can and do contribute the results of the work they do in this regard upstream to FOSS projects. This has never not been the case, and when government-employed developers release the work they do to meet their own security requirements to the broader community, everyone benefits.But this is drastically different from the scenario that the preceding poster was proposing, in which government officials would assume effective responsibility for the entire project, not just act as participants in the FOSS community.That proposal would invert the situation, and change it from government devs adhering to the norms and conventions of the community to the community adhering to the rules and priorities defined by the government, which is where the negatives I outlined above would come into play.

2019-11-30 21:55:48.000	Freedom of speech lies on a spectrum. You can currently speak your mind on the internet, with little fear of the virtually non-existent threat of de-anonymization. That is a good thing for the well-intentioned majority. Any marginal increase in fear of speech reduces freedom of speech, so making de-anonymization easier doesn t teach em a lesson. It just kills something beautiful, something that must be protected. Don t get me wrong, I don t think this tool alone would do that, but it s another step in that direction.What next? A publicly available ML web crawler that analyzes speech and belief patterns, triangulates them with metadata, and returns someone s identity with 99 confidence? I m not naive enough to believe the government won t build that, but for that to be freely available is just a recipe for chaos. It should be illegal, and it should be illegal to distribute many intermediate tools as well.
2018-02-03 10:45:36.000	This amazingly misses the point.

Birds too need follow the laws of physics.With intelligence, no one knows what the laws are. That is Hofstader s point.

So instead of having the base station broadcast its SSID in one spot, you instead have clients broadcasting that SSID everywhere they go, disclosing not only the SSID itself but also their association to it. I wish OSes would go a step further and deanonymize hidden SSIDs, just to drive home to everyone that this feature sucks and doesn t work.

So, even if a bot does join, it ostensibly won t MITM the intended recipient when they say my ID is ZXCV-BNMA , so you can still tell if the recipient is in.Obviously it s not going to be secure against coordinated attacks by governments which I will also make clear , but my intention is to have it be secure enough for 99 of people while being easy to use. It ll at least be more secure than Dropbox Box Skype whatever, which aren t secure in the slightest.Mega, for example, might be secure, but I haven t personally seen their implementation, don t trust them not to implement any backdoors, and don t trust them not to change it.

2021-04-13 06:39:29.000	The climate has always changed. Nothing in the universe is ever not changing, so climate change is not the real name of this issue. Maybe the concern is actually CO2 emissions. Humans have added about 100 ppm of CO2 to the atmosphere over about a century. It s unknown and unknowable what effect this is having, because we live in the most complex of complex systems. People often try to simulate it via models , aka garbage closed-source programs, but they re toys and cannot possibly tell us much, because complex systems are fundamentally not amenable to simulation. But if we look at Earth s history, 400 ppm of CO2 is not much. Not long ago, CO2 ppm was twice what it is today, and there was no disaster. Stepping back and trying to analyze the situation more fundamentally, we know that the planet has encased itself in ice and then thawed itself multiple times, all without human intervention.But climate change is a perfect bogeyman for the left. It invokes primal fear, guilt about our decadent living standards, etc. And most importantly, it happens so slowly that by the time the predictions are shown to be false, everyone s forgotten about them, or it s been so long that it s easy to suggest that the predictions weren t serious. There s a vast graveyard of false predictions that the MSM doesn t want to talk about, because Things are actually OK, there is no crisis is not going to get anyone to click.Point being, someone near you is actually suffering, and you have the power to help them. The problem is happening now, it s verifiable with your own eyes, and you can improve the situation with your own hands, in a reasonable amount of time, and witness the aftermath yourself. IMO, that s a much better thing to work on than an alleged crisis that, twenty years hence, will still not have arrived. Doomsday will have been postponed, and nobody will believe you when you tell them about the false predictions that were made about the poor polar bears, or the walruses, or the penguins, or the glaciers, or snow in general, or sea levels, or the coral reefs, etc.
2021-06-07 01:18:55.000	I have been thinking a lot about Systems Thinking recently. Will Larson writes in An Elegant Puzzle Systems of Engineering Management that it s one of the most useful general tools he s discovered for approaching management problems. That inspired me to read Donella Meadows Thing in Systems, but even after reading that, I m not sure how to apply it to engineering organizations. It s only tangential to this topic, but if anyone has a good course or book that works through examples which can be transferred to managing engineering teams or organizations, I d be grateful. When I read most systems thinking materials I get the sense that they are mostly focused on civilization-level problems like global warming, rather than on ways that I can individually use it to understand and make changes within my more prosaic scope.I also have a little bit of the feeling that the emperor has no clothes, since in spite of all their ideas, I can t find any major company that has successfully transformed an industry based on systems thinking, nor can I find any major social ill that has been solved through the application of systems thinking. If anyone has any concrete cases of those, I d also be interested.I have a blog post working on applying Donella Meadows Leverage Points to an engineering problem incident retrospectives , but it s unsatisfying enough that I haven t figured out how to make it publishable.

But they define that as a public key-based routing, which doesn t take into account optimal routing in the network. Nodes are ordered by public key 1 . It s good for P2P mesh, not wireless offgrid meshes.And their SNEK routing does prefer the internet over Bluetooth 2 we can further refine the path to use either the faster or lower latency link type to route to that peer If the Best candidate has a slower peer connection type Multicast Remote Bluetooth than the connected peer 0

2010-08-13 02:00:48.000	I completely agree that pulling the app was justified, given Apple s stated rules, and also that it was incredibly stupid on taptaptap s part. They ve managed to get their cash cow slaughtered for no reason other than perhaps getting some buzz -- though the people this buzz is reaching most likely overlaps highly with people who ve already heard about the product, so I can t imagine it helping too much.What I don t agree with is Apple s Iron Fist on products, and how they assume all of their users are fairly unintelligent and easily amused. My brother gave me an iPod Touch and I ve just started using it. There s no icon to download apps, and to re-sync it or whatever the hell I need to do I have to download iTunes quicktime The Entire Archived Internet and go through an agonizingly long and painful process of clicking no everytime it tries to do me the favor of downloading album art for thousands of albums so that when I browse by album I will be able to see the ALBUM COVERS and it will look SO COOL. It just works entails iTunes spending days determining gapless playback information yet mysteriously having the App Store Button not present on the device and not telling me why. I found the answer on Yahoo Answers by somebody who I suspect was typing with their feet.Assuming I go through the process of upgrading the Touch, which I probably won t, I ll need to provide my name, address, 3 credit card numbers, tag myself with a GPS transmitter, and fax them scanned fingerprints in order to download free Apps which they can assure me will not ever let my volume buttons be used for any other purpose, no matter how convenient.Sigh. It s turned into a rant. The decision they made affects users as much as developers, it ultimately says You may want this feature, but you can t have it. Trust us, it s for your own good. Long story short, I personally don t care for that type of mentality. I won t deny the market loves it, but I m not really sold. They re starting to appeal to me as the McDonald s of computers, only it s like the McDonald s in other countries where it costs more because it s a novelty and you re cool as long as you buy into the commercials and sports sponsorships.

You re doing yourself a disservice not learning find and grep.And I do poke fun at the rewrite it in rust crowd even though I think Rust itself is incredibly exciting. There s nothing as easy as reinventing existing tools in a greenfield code base. Inventing truly new things and maintaining old code are both much harder and much more valuable. Not saying that the existing tools don t need an update every now and then, but I m not particularly impressed, despite these things being flashy.
2023-08-15 20:17:40.000	Also lets you tell when people approach the door but don t ring, especially if you have some kind of person detection going. My mailman drops stuff on the porch all the time and never bothers to ring the doorbell which is annoying, but I get a little beep and a thumbnail inside from my home automation platform to let me know someone was on the porch.Plus generally having a recording of your front porch area is useful for security. I ve been able to pull video recordings of stuff to prove disprove things happened, for instance when the mailman ran over a bunch of stuff in my front yard and drove off.

2024-08-19 06:46:03.000	90 of software development happens in the mind.Why? The only reason I can think of for this to be true is when there is high risk in writing wrong code. For example, long compile times leading to a large sunken cost, or a lack of testing processes.Unless you re doing R D, only spending 10 of your coding time actually writing code seems very low, and you should try to optimize the processes that are lacking.
2024-06-14 21:06:03.000	I just put all 6 of the examples above into Excel as text, then used DATEVALUE to parse them. It worked correctly for all 6. However, in the immediate parent comment, you mention d m y format, which 3 of the examples above could not be, so perhaps the details of the issue you ve encountered are more subtle such as 2-digit years that require context to determine the century but, at present, it looks like DATEVALUE handles this well.

2021-11-05 22:15:08.000	Right, I meant my point to be that you can find evidence on both sides. Far as I can see, language is not a predictor of success.Having an advocate for a program is a predictor. That advocate doesn t have to be a developer.

2021-03-25 05:47:37.000	It s easy to feel that iOS isn t on your side when you can t use a non-WebKit browser and can t use an adblocker.Not only does Safari allow for 3rd-party adblock extensions that are pretty good, there are iOS browsers available, like iCab Mobile 0 for instance, that allow for extremely fine-grained, granular and tweakable ad-blocking, filtering, domain-blocking, and CSS and javascript rules - all of which can be user-edited and refined to fit exactly the user s own requirements.There are always so many comments like the above in these threads often characterized by people banging on iOS because it can t be customized the way I want it after I paid so much for my iPhone . But these seem to be just standard consumer-mindset complaining from users that don t even have the intellectual curiosity to investigate whether there s actually anything already available that solves their imagined problem, or even try to fix it themselves - just as the article says. 0

2013-12-15 22:21:58.000	I grew up in the mid-Atlantic region of the U.S. and saw it both ways. Butter on sandwiches just sort of seems like just another way to make one, like some people like Mayonnaise I don t or not. I d probably put it on a jam sandwich, or a ham and cheese, but not a PB J the Peanut Butter takes on the same role .Of course I also grew up in very immigrant heavy areas so that may have been part of it.
2016-11-04 18:14:15.000	The whole better angels of our nature optimism thing kind of seems like sticking your head in the sand to me.I think it s a necessary counterbalance to a 24 hour news cycle that brings the most violent and strife-filled events into constant focus. It is easy to get the impression that the world is worse than its ever been. That s why it s important to take a step back and see a different perspective that accurately reflects how the world today compares to the past -- a past which we as humans are biased towards romanticizing anyway. My current pessimism about the future is not a function of how bad things currently are-- it has definitely been much worse-- but that all the incentives are aligned toward making it worse and I don t see many people or forces aligned toward making it better.That is one perspective that may or may not manifest into measurable worseness in the future. Some people have a different perspective, and could point to things like
2017-01-22 03:58:42.000	There have been serious arguments made that too much transparency is crippling the US government s ability to function.Used to be a lot more compromises made in private, to come up with trade offs both sides could live with but the partisan core supporters would shoot down immediately if they knew. Which leads to our current government, where compromise with the other side of any kind is political suicide.

2022-12-01 00:08:11.000	Functor has been used in multiple ways in different fields. It s apparently a term of art in linguistics we call C classes implementing operator functors Prolog terms have parts called functors apparently imported from linguistics and of course category theory has them.As far as mathematics is generally concerned, I think the category theory concept is the origin. Monoids, on the other hand, did exist before category theory the modern conception as one-object categories is nice, but it s definitely an import.

2017-07-26 20:12:24.000	I think there is some value in having a relatively small number of transport-level protocols with known semantics.If every web page would effectively reinvent their own transport-level protocol including subtly different connection handling, congestion behavior and drop reorder tolerance, that sounds like it would make life a nightmare for all network intermediaries. I know the transport-level protocol is technically UDP but that doesn t count because all he practically relevant aspects are defined on top of it Also, ICE etc solves a real problem - that users of Web UDP would have to deal with as well. Why demand that everyone reinvents the solution for themselves if we can include a standard solution in the browsers for everyone?
2020-03-16 04:57:37.000	This particular bug actually comes from C . In C , threads may be assumed to always make forward progress, i.e. side-effect-free infinite loops are UB. However, this is not true in CThat s very much disputed. The C standard requires programs behaviour to be as-if executed on the C abstract machine when they terminate. It s not at all clear whether the standard imposes any requirements on programs that would not terminate when executed on the C abstract machine.

2020-04-16 14:47:19.000	If you append data to an executable there is no guarantee it s actually going to end up mapped in memory for you.I didn t state it clearly enough, but I didn t say anything about it being mapped. It almost certainly isn t mapped. Loaders do not blindly map the whole thing to memory then you would end up with debug info unconditionally mapped.Even if it were mapped, the program wouldn t easily find it with the latter approach I described the offset given in the structure is measured from the start of the file, not from some address in memory. ask the linkerIt is not portable either. For instance, it doesn t work with Microsoft s linker which is called link.exe.

But being that he s of the party that s not in power in the state, there s very little he can do.I also requested that he co-sponsor one of the bills that greatly increases penalties for defrauding the system it s currently pretty much a slap on the wrist .The vast majority of Americans are entirely unaware that most of the day-to-day laws and systems are implemented at state level aside from griping about governor s office executive orders . There s one news network that reports on our state s government affairs and hardly anyone watches it. But everyone knows the second a federal politician does something.
2012-07-02 01:30:12.000	Seems like you have a vector of functions and a set of control functions. Each control function resolves dependencies, in such a way that the vector of functions can execute parallely while maintaining a correct order of execution.It s definitely clever, but I can t believe they were granted a patent for this. It would be like patenting the map reduce framework.

2023-10-07 04:03:47.000	You can t use the types in runtime so all that effort you put into the types doesn t actually translate when you want to use the type system to full effect.This isn t really the problem runtime types would solve the issue, but they re a sledgehammer with all sorts of nasty effects elsewhere. Languages with far stronger type systems than F still have type erasure it s actually fairly unusual in that regard.The core weakness of TS aside from the fact that its type system isn t actually sound is that it doesn t have type-directed emit you can t automatically generate safe parsers, for instance, because you can t generate anything. Except enums why those got a pass is beyond me.

2019-02-23 16:54:59.000	The reality is that it s a judgement call.Some people have good health and boundless energy. For such people, spending more hours working can pay off -- at least, in the short run. They may actually be heading towards burnout without realizing it.Some people don t have that kind of energy. Pushing themselves too hard actually hurts their productivity in the short term.It can also vary over time for the same person. Maybe some weeks, they can do more, but other weeks, they really need some recharge time.Wisdom is almost always specific to a particular set of details and is about a person having deep knowledge of that specific situation and acting on it in an informed manner. It tends to not generalize as well as we would like.
2024-05-19 12:34:32.000	I guess restaurants avoid it because of its long-range effects. In 1981, a German landlord evicted a tenant without notice after the tenant spread surströmming brine in the apartment building s stairwell. When the landlord was taken to court, the court ruled that the termination was justified after the landlord s party demonstrated their case by opening a can inside the courtroom.

2019-10-18 14:51:17.000	As, I and you link say... pork and poultry is a different story. Dairy, beef lamb are farmed differently here. There is nuance.This is a disingenuous way of making an argument. Existence of factory farming isn t in dispute. It exists. ...as does regular farming! How can you possibly argue that decent farming eg dairy doesn t exist. Decent farming exists. Widely. Profitably. I m looking out my window at decently raised cows right now.If you think farming is wrong in principle, that s fine. We can debate this. Arguing that farming is inevitably dominated by bad factory farming practices is nonsense.

2016-10-20 16:21:45.000	The Wii was a success the way the pet rock was. They sold a huge number of them but it didn t take long before they were mostly just used as paper weights. It was under powered, had almost no 3rd party support, and wasn t even HD.

So perhaps it wasn t a failure but it was a huge disappointment.
2014-01-12 17:54:53.000	VC pitfalls have been covered several times over. Most of my knowledge of that world is through friends who ve tried to raise. I was technically a co-founder in my first startup, but the CEO had raised before 40M in the 90s and so I let him handle that. I m not a fan of that CEO-- he got me to spend 3 years of my life on a project that had no chance even though he was perennially on the cusp of funding, he was also under a VC blackball-- but I m also not a fan of what his 90s ex-investors did to him. Whether the man deserved it, I can t say. It looks like there was pretty major fault on all sides.On the employee angle, here s a blog post I wrote a year and a half ago I would say is to avoid falling prey to the exceptionalism, the yes, we pay poorly but we re changing the world nonsense. If they value you, they ll pay you. If they say they absolutely can t afford more than 0.05 for an engineer, either they re lying or they did a terrible job of negotiating with investors and the founders no longer call the shots . Don t make excuses for shitty people and companies just leave them.The same principles that apply in big companies apply in small ones. You ll have good bosses and bad. Young startups tend to have more bad ones. Focus on your career goals, and always watch your back a little bit. Don t sacrifice your career, reputation, network or anything else for a company, ever. It wouldn t do the same for you.

When I m derailed by a bug in some library I m depending on, or see code that works in a way I find unintuitive, clunky, etc., I absolutely think judgmentally about the person who wrote it.When I m reading someone else s code and find a solution that s significantly more elegant than I was imagining, I m impressed by the person s accomplishment, and they basically get points in my head. If I meet them in person I ll quite possibly shake their hand a bit more warmly.This is normal and natural, and I have to consciously counter-balance that with the learned but not instinctive... knowledge that I ve written bad code myself, released buggy or clunky code, taken questionable shortcuts, etc..When I m in a position to criticize someone else s code and it s part of my job to do it sometimes! I usually rewrite my feedback a few times and sometimes decide it s not needed at all before writing or speaking to the developer, because it takes a lot of conscious thought to modify my instinctive response into something more fair and effective based on what I ve learned over the years.That s my experience.Does everyone else actually think that differently?

But that is to offset the cost of public transport, reduce traffic and of course generate revenue. I lost count of how many BMWs I have seen parked in HDB parking lots though furthermore, there s a lot of taxes we need to pay and we don t even know where these tax goes to!However in my opinion this is something I do not agree with, taxes in Singapore are extremely low. The highest tax rate is 20 at that is on 320,000 and above, 7 GST which is applicable for businesses above 1m income . Then there are annual GST rebates, spouse rebates etc.

2019-04-04 18:50:49.000	No, the argument is specifically that the harm from following up on false positives outweighs the benefit from finding true positives. While the 2011 study that the Medicare policy change is based on specifically concludes that this will not be the case, the concern is that the study found a lower false positive rate than would be seen in the wild, due to better skill and greater diligence from the radiologists participating in the study.Harm from false positives is a real thing, especially for a test with a relatively high false positive rate and relatively invasive followup to false positives they don t state it specifically, but the theater analogy implies 66X more false positives than true Furthermore, unlike an auto mechanic who might not be able to bill much for finding problems the owner doesn t want fixed, or following up on a diagnostic computer finding that turns out to not be a problem at all, the healthcare system at large stands to profit from both the screening and the follow up on those false positives, so the bean counting manager shouldn t be applying pressure to skip the screening.

I think the problem, as always, is how we use this kind of information. I ve see HR teams get all excited about the team fit of a person based on Myers Brigg when it was pretty clear to the team itself that was not the case. However, I once had a colleague who I found difficult to work with the situation was mutual but after a profiling session I discovered they were more introverted than I thought and came to understood what that meant. This lead to a great improvement in our relationship. Sure maybe a good old chat might have sorted it out but I guess that s what the profiling session was.I m an ENTP by the way.

Otherwise you are not yourself anymore.Thats a very strong claim which you provide no basis for, in that comment or in your follow-ups. Maybe replication at the level of neurons, as opposed to atoms, would work? Or maybe at an even higher level? We don t know yet. Are we more intelligent than homo sapiens 3000 years ago? Perhaps more scholarly, more literate, more capable of engineering complex systems. But our inherent, base intelligence is not any different.We don t have the ability to self-modify, or to scale our intelligence horizontally e.g. by copying it to more hardware , which an entity executing on a computer system could have. That s one of the main points of the argument for singularity.Your post is extremely dismissive of the singularity arguments, but you don t seem very familiar with them e.g. that the singularity argument doesnt apply to just human upload, and also covers artificial intelligence read the wikipedia article .I d personally agree that people who say a singularity will happen at some specific date soon are over-speculating too.

VAT handling is optional for small businesses in most European countries and it has nothing to do with device capabilities or types of software. Tell me a reason that is valid for desktop software but not for other types of store apps, a reason that is valid for some device capabilities but not others! They are creating unnecessary dependencies between unrelated things distribution deployment, types of software, permissions capabilities, taxes social security . That s what incidental complexity is all about. But, in European countries at least, you have the option to register as a Sole Proprietorship ... for developers trying to experiment it is perfectRegistering as a sole trader usually means that you have to pay minimum social security contributions even if you make a loss. In the UK that s just 20 Euros or so, but in most other European countries it s between 200 and 300 Euros per month. If you re self funded that hurts.

2024-09-04 07:11:32.000	Is there any application of Modern Standby that is actually delivering significant value to customers somewhere? A lot of the theoretical benefits of it, IMO, have been relatively theoretical. Perhaps Windows updates, but the computers I ve used with Modern Standby still have to spend time installing updates when awake.I cannot imagine what the benefit of receiving notifications and other information like this on a Windows system would be. As far as I know, very, very few apps are programmed for the native App development flow or even to use the notifications api as opposed to desktop apps, and the number only gets smaller as you go into long tail enterprise apps. Perhaps this was designed for Outlook, but I think the use case is dubious.Of course, there are millions of laptops in the wild, many of which are undoubtedly used by the people who work on Windows. Every time I find the laptop closed and running its fans, or find a computer in a bag that is slightly warm near the CPU expected behaviour of working Modern Standby , I wonder whether it s just my computer or if it s every single one of them out there. Do people just accept that their computer has to be either shut down or will have an unknown amount of remaining power? It seems like there would have been a huge push to get this fixed if it was really broken, but I rarely hear users talking about it.Of course I do wonder whether with the advent of the new Qualcomm ARM CPUs, whether they have finally managed to get Modern Standby to be a good clone of what Android devices do...

2015-05-08 06:47:18.000	My experience with heavily metaprogrammed Ruby is that this story has a dark side. Yes, when language and program fit one another well, you end up with code which is clear, small, and efficient. That is true... until you need to add a new feature that was not accounted for in the language design. Now you have to wade into the code of the compiler .Abstraction generally gives up flexibility to obtain conciseness. Certainly a balance must be struck, but not flexible enough has caused me vastly more pain than not concise enough . As a consultant who frequently wades into other people s code, I generally consider metaprogramming to be a scourge.

The enclosure makes it look a lot wider than a person on a normal bicycle, but it really isn t much different.So this is actually an advantage one of the problems with bicycles is that car drivers underestimate just how wide a person on a bicycle really is and how much room they need. The wheels might be skinny, but add a body and handlebars, and it becomes much wider.

Gates behavior wasn t an example of competence he was a bully on a power trip.The cognitive load of asking a question or making an objection is generally lighter than giving an honest counter-argument. Especially if the question or objection is a profanity-smeared act of belligerence and the answers have to be polite or else you re fired. Examinations are formidable even to the best prepared, for the greatest fool may ask more than the wisest man can answer. - Charles Caleb Colton

The government can also choose to devalue the currency to reduce outstanding liabilities.

And then have the cheek to call this brave and good for the customer.Or when you release a machine with one USB port to be shared with charging and peripherals.Or opinion alert when you take progressive steps to lock down your system more and more and more at the expense of power users. Run whatever the user wants - Run signed code only with an override - Run signed only with an override that reverts back after a period of time - exercise for the reader Or 2x opinion alert when you compromise on battery life and muscle memory and hence usability for a misfeature that adds questionable value that nobody actually wanted in the first place.Apple s all about pleasing their customers perhaps, but at some point, their customer stopped being me and started being someone else.

Migra targets a different kind of development flow but it is also in the migration space. My tool, pgmigrate, would be a good way to apply migrations created by Migra.It is unfortunate that the Migra project is abandoned, I believe djrobstep has gotten into political advocacy and spends most of his efforts on things other than programming at this point. I say unfortunate because he is extremely talented and I have learned a lot reading and working with his code. Hopefully he comes back at some point to help transition Migra to some other maintainers and fix the website and such

2023-12-05 11:43:00.000	Agreed - and just to drive home a point you touched on the foundation of SemVer is an arbitrarily defined public API .Imagine a project which consists of a library, a CLI tool, and perhaps a GUI. Is the library API part of the public API? That s for you to decide according to SemVer. Is removing renaming a CLI flag a breaking change? Also for you to decide. Is removing major functionality from the GUI a breaking change?..you get the picture. Every project defines their public API for themselves.This isn t a made-up example, many projects have a library and a CLI, with one considered to be the main project while the other is something most people are not expected to use.Heck, even following SemVer to the exact letter often doesn t communicate information how people expect. For example, say your library exposes a piece of metadata from the underlying OS a function returning a string . But in Windows 10 - Windows 11, they changed the API to return an string instead of a single string . If you want your software to run on Windows 11, you have no choice but to change your public API in a breaking, non-backwards-compatible way.Cool, no problem, according to SemVer we bump our public API version from v1.0 to v2.0 now, right? But wait! 99 of our users do not even make use of this one-off weird function! In fact, we think we could remove it without anyone complaining but it s technically part of our public API..SemVer has no way to express we had to make a breaking change that doesn t affect 99 of users , it just has a way to express breaking change . If you follow SemVer, then that means your project needs to go from v1.0 - v2.0 in that case, yes - and now you get to explain to your users why v1.0 - v2.0 is not, in fact, a major change despite it being defined as such semantically.What most people think of as SemVer, in practice, is often _romantic versioning_ or _sentimental versioning_ and not _semantic versioning_.

A clay foot algorithm.I ve had 100 square miles alone to myself in the BWCA for days weeks and know the park well.Since the BWCA is adjacent to the Quetico on the Canadian side of the border , the concept of remote skews much further north. Time of year is also remote ... late October early November is beautiful, if you don t get iced-in for winter and can neither canoe nor walk out.A relatively remote lake is Lake Kiana, where I ve been between two simultaneous wolf packs 100 yds and 150 yards away in opposite directions . BWCA is where Yellowstone re-populated its wolves from. That close to 20-25 wolves chasing deer in the deep of night ... you listen for the yip, yip, yip of the pups trying to learn and keep up.

2014-04-21 10:48:01.000	If we couldn t scientifically deal with this scenario, we d hardly do any science.Feel free to change the topic. Science is very clearly defined, and an absence of falsifiability is fatal.Either 1. A theory can potentially be falsified by new evidence, or2. IT IS NOT SCIENCE. The concern with falsifiability gained attention by way of philosopher of science Karl Popper s scientific epistemology falsificationism . Popper stresses the problem of demarcation distinguishing the scientific from the unscientific and makes falsifiability the demarcation criterion, such that what is unfalsifiable is classified as unscientific, and the practice of declaring an unfalsifiable theory to be scientifically true is pseudoscience. Which part of the above didn t you understand? When it touches the real world, you have to deal with imperfection.As I said, feel free to change the subject.

But not a good feeling about what it means for my life.In the SF area, it s not enough to live with a family. Where my wife and I are from, it s enough to early-retire with average incomes 4 of 2M 80k y, 40k y median income . But do I want to do this? Or do I keep working my job?My job is alright, and I make pretty good money. I ve been progressing along so far and doing well. But would I rather not have to attend meetings I don t feel like? Yes. But would I rather ride a bike everyday that I want? Yes. Would I rather play games for hours? Yes. Would I rather learn to machine stuff with a CNC? Yes. Would I rather learn new maths, sciences, engineering fields? Yes. Would I rather go sailing around the world? Yes.Or at least for a while. But then I d probably get tired of it. And then I can t do too crazy stuff because we have young kids that need to grow up. And then I couldn t afford the sustained expenses, and then want to go back to work. But then I d have a gap in my resume and worry about having lost touch with my network and career.We re already debt free and save a large amount of our income every pay-check. We re not interested in buying a house or living in a fancier place. Not interested in a fancier car. We don t want to flash like we re wealthy. We want to be able to hangout with our friends without making them uncomfortable.So what do I even do with this money? I ve never been taught how to be wealthy . Before all this became reality, I thought I knew what I d do, I had so many ideas. Now that it s there... crickets.

Or hand-made websites if we want to go further back or right now if you use zonelets How would this article read if you replace any Mastodon mention with blogging?There have been ways to communicate and receive feedback from that communication for quite a while. They re not particularly cool, or sexy, or whatever you want to call them. And that s fine.The real value here is the people you connect with, the network effect as it s been named. It was blogging years ago, then centralised social media took over. Maybe it s time for the next thing.Re Mastodon - ActivityPub is the protocol and maybe the secret sauce, but it looks to me that Mastodon is the case of an overnight success 5 years in the making. I remember opening a Mastodon account in 2017 and not giving it much importance, but now that conditions have changed, I see it with much more value than 5 years ago.
2023-09-19 15:08:59.000	I ve spent time looking at a map of my city, and it s pretty easy to see the transition. The older streetcar suburbs have streets on a grid, and alleys down the middle of every block. The post WW2 areas are all widely separated and full of cul-de-sacs, and the alleys are gone.Walking anywhere in the older areas is easy, though a lot of the amenities like mom and pop stores are now gone. Walking anywhere in the newer areas is pretty much impossible. The streets don t connect and there is nowhere to walk to.

Nice sit down restaurant, good food, linen napkins.Consequently highly skilled, senior engineers can be paid Once you embrace remote work WFH you quickly discover this very real geographical swing in value-of-money.Of course -most- remote workers are crap. Most local workers are crap too. The remote-hiring problem is as hard as the local-hiring problem, probably harder. But the cost-savings are immense, and the long-term PR is significant.

I do think a lot of Musk shorts relatively speaking do this.
2022-09-25 23:08:00.000	I realized a few thingsFirst is that sometimes event happens that just suck, and your life will suck until you can get away from that situation for a while e.g. a loved one dies, life sucks for a while. The only option is to embrace the situation and bear it with whatever grace you can muster.Second is that a life that is stably worth living is one with multiple pillars of support. Mine are family, friends, hiking, reading, and my career. Because I have so many sources of joy and comfort, some of these can fall through e.g. It s ok if I don t see friends for a few weeks and life is still worth living. Learn to build and sustain these pillars in your life.Third, in support of the second point, a life worth living requires a bare minimum of resources. Figure out what that is for you, figure out a plan that will give you that minimum, then execute.Fourth, a life worth living may not always be happy, but might instead be fulfilling . To the second and third points, setting yourself a goal and making concrete steps is something I and many others find fulfilling. Not realizing this till later in life is one of my bigger regrets.Best of luck.

Also, automate of the production of different products is differing very much. You can not compare for example car factoring with software development or food production.Of course, you can argue that cheap energy gives an industry an advantage. But what happens here are things that are independent of each other. For example, labor costs in China have risen and it gets more difficult to find cheap and adequate workers.Also you always should consider the consequences Will the short-terim-advantage for some ! industries really outweigh the long-term consequences?

But the suggestions are far better compared to what we heard before. I don t agree with everything, but this is a more constructive approach.Not that I think browser TLS warnings are good, since they are heavily paternalizing, Edge being the worst with special options to even have the ability to ignore TLS errors. I can see the need in a corporate environment however that there is policy control to really enforce TLS.Still, an error remains that people rely on politics to fix hate on the internet. Hate - as if this emotion isn t prevalent between two very split groups of people. What do you do to love the others a bit more? What good can liberals say about conservatives and vice versa? Not possible? That problem isn t fixed by big tech speech control.

The essence of what you seem to be doing uber simple the the home page states , is what had me interested.But, after seeing your video, and the number of times a user has to click on different elements - it s clear this is not a simple logging tool. I also think the video could be a called out above the fold and b include some sort of voice over.I feel there is a market ready and waiting for those that work on more abstract sorts of things. Situations where work might form more organically from a blog post on it s happened or a small idea more frequent , and eventually turns into billing or a larger scale project. With tools like these that are project-based - It feels like logging friction is much to high.The problem is not being solved in my opinion because generally no one wants to log what they do, but for those that have decided to do so, there should be little to no clicking and a process to capture everything written in very low overhead manner mobile support is essential .So far, no tool seems to be as good as a simple OTA sync ed calendar. So far.

In that respect investment is more like graduate admissions, which is done by professors instead of admissions officers, and the professors get whoever they select as grad students. And incidentally, I went to grad school at Harvard, not to Harvard College.

For the student to make any progress he need to be able to understand most of the things in the speech this is called comprehensible input, and the theory is both applicable to listening and reading . That s why there are people living in foreign country for years yet cannot speak or understand the language at all.Also it s kinda stupid to say that language learning must be either grammar voc learning or listening it needs to be both. Classes are needed because they make portion of listening material comprehensible, which is impossible by listening only.

Unfortunately, it isn t.It s not that we forget about the tasks, but that we subconsciously do not have any interest to complete them. He suggests that we ask ourselves why that may be the case. Fixing THAT, by some introspection, instead of introducing a contrived method of managing your tasks such as a list is the only reliable and lasting method of getting things done.Boy is this relevant to me right now!

Sex trafficking includes among other commercial coerced sex any instance of prostitution which involves anything other than free and full consent from someone with capacity to consent to sex minors by definition lack capacity to consent, so pimping a minor is an offense which falls completely within the bounds of sex trafficking. Unlike simple pimping, solicitation, etc., which may overlap with sex trafficking, but also include acts which are not sex trafficking.
2018-11-16 06:16:36.000	If by American and Western interests, you mean the values western society is built on, the answer should be pretty simple national security is no excuse for secret courts, secret prosecutions and secret rulings. It s also to be expected that this society is going to provide more opportunities for leaks in the first place, as opposed to more totalitarian societies. Not that there isn t sufficient grounds for arguing that distinction has already blurred for the most relevant purposes.It s also to be expected that WL s every move is scrutinized. But anti-WL action went much, much further, including a complete financial boycott from above. That was years before any allegations of Russian meddling ever entered the picture. The US has openly targeted them for years, but if they hold any grudge about this in return in the form of not pulling punches and maximizing publication impact, it is supposed to reflect badly on them? That seems more than a little unbalanced.The skepticism only goes one way. WL has a perfect track record in accuracy. Their own story however is regularly misrepresented and misstated. Plus, never forget that it was a Guardian journalist who was dumb enough to leak the crucial password to the full diplomatic archive, in the same book where they admitted to being too dumb to Google how to open a 7zip file. Such their missteps from the traditional press are casually excused in a game of closing ranks that reminds one more of cops than renegades. So much for the enlightened and free press they needed a bunch of crypto nerds to show them how it is done, after the tech industry stole their collective lunches, and they handed over control of their platforms and income to hordes of shady surveillance capitalists.The traditional press warmongering and American mythologizing is also a naked fact. So much that they even held off on the Trump bashing for a while, when he was banging that drum, calling it presidential .So who is really using power over whom? Who is using truth for whuch cause, and who is publishing self serving fluff pieces instead? Why should we worry about WL, when the American fish is clearly rotting from the head down, and those who are supposed to stop that are incapable of doing so?
2009-06-30 04:58:32.000	What happens if the non-grad only invests 1 because that s all they can afford? The world is basically divided into two categories of people those who can afford to save 10 of their income and those who are currently accumulating additional debt I, as a college student, am in the latter group . The odds that your expenses exactly match the amount you need to spend are pretty small. If you find that you have exactly 0 left over at the end of the month- you don t have savings, but you aren t accumulating debt- you re probably just increasing your expenses until they match your income. You can live decently on 10K after-tax in this country. If the college grad invests all of their extra money, how long does it take them to catch up? Not long at all, but people don t. The American national savings rate is negative.
2019-10-12 19:57:11.000	Well, the good news is that you ve completely misunderstood my comment. There s no histrionics, nor piety. I don t care what other people do for their kids I said this elsewhere in the thread , and I can imagine that other people, especially people with disabilities, might find the magnets to a useful option. But for me, zippers are easy and work just fine. Therefore there s no need to take even a small risk to replace something that works just fine.Another consideration is the flood of cheap counterfeits on Amazon commingled at times , which means that you can t actually trust that the item you purchase is the genuine article i.e., that it s as well-built as the descriptions say . SoI m not sure what snowplow helicopter parenting has to do with any of this, but I m right there with you that people do too much of that.If anyone out there decides not to have kids because I don t buy baby clothes with magnets, I think they care too much about what other people do with their own babies .

2019-06-22 14:57:30.000	If it helps, I am certainly in favor of opt-out organ donation. I don t hold religious beliefs.I think you are applying utilitarianism to a point where it is no longer useful. Sure, I guess if a dissident is executed we might as well make good use of it, right? But this misses the forest for the trees. An ethical climate like this makes for a worse society overall, since people will naturally be inclined to do worse things out of their own subjective interpretation of utilitarian value. In a place where people try to aim for abstract and idealistic moral values, you paradoxically have a situation where life gets easier as there is an additional mental block against poor incentive cycles such as arresting more dissidents and destroying more families to have more organs.There s a reason why abstract moral frameworks like abrahamic religion have enjoyed a good evolutionary run. Ultimately calculating utility in a helpful way is an almost impossible task for a group humans with different aims. That s why the satisfaction of coming up with edgy utilitarian conclusions is in fact a red herring.
2017-05-24 06:37:43.000	My theory has been that people with ADHD tend to end up having lives with rough social interaction, and you end up living a childhood more prone to creative endeavors like reading books or other activities you can do alone.I know quite a few people with ADHD and they are the opposite, they tend to have trouble reading books, especially thick ones, due to their trouble to focus for longer periods.

As for promotion, the local population is gradually being swamped by foreign contant in texts, books, airwaves and videos - people are voting with theur eyeballs. It may be i8mpossible to ever get a Maori literature, like French, German, English etc, but even those are being forced to fight against Franglais . In a free country it may not ever be possible to eliminate majority imperialism - people do what they like. How can they make their yound people like the Maori language and culture in such a way that it endures? That is the problem.

I mean, come on nearly everyone is an asshole at 16. God knows I was. And when you are 16, you are mostly around other 16 year old assholes, and you are treated like an asshole by adults, because, well, you probably are one.For me, when I was that age, my favorite part of any day was going to my part-time IT job, where I helped county workers mostly 40 with their windows problems. The contrast between interacting with adults who treated me like a real human being that had something to offer and the rest of my life was extreme.And really, I don t think my life was that unusual. I mean, besides the after-school IT job.

You can leverage existing .NET libraries for example, you get official GCP libraries from google and if you use them enough it s easy enough to write a functional wrapper around them.

Which would mean the really deep space between galaxies. But then you d have to watch out for ies, too!Whose jet s could fry us even more easily, because out there , we wouldn t be protected by the pressure of solar stellar galactic wind, dust clouds, nebula, which could protect us if we are lucky .

2018-11-18 16:12:18.000	What I am interested to know is if meditation correlates with increased ability to cope with life problems. Because many people treat it like a refuge from the hardships of life, not a super boost in mental powers.I have hardcore practiced meditation for 20 years and some of my colleagues who were doing the same were in a pretty bad state - unmarried, with a low level job and not owning their house. They weren t on average happier than normal people.I attribute their failure to the philosophy of detachment and switching from normal life goals to spiritual goals . It was all a bust. They were exploited by the school under which we practiced. I had the good sense to keep my life separate from the practice so I wasn t affected as much.Maybe it s a problem of the school I followed, but the same idea of detachment is part of all schools. In the end what matters is survival, and in today society, it means building your career and family, not just sitting still.To the down-voters can you contradict me after 7000 hours of meditation, where you actually achieve the experiences mentioned in the ancient texts? Meditation worked very well for me, it was the general direction that was bad. We re supposed to maximise our rewards, including having children, not replacing this with an artificial abstract goal. Our rewards are selected and chiseled by evolution, they are what made us survive and thrive.
2019-08-29 21:25:56.000	I ve never used Facebook, so I don t know how well Diaspora can compete, but it seems like a possibility. For Twitter, there s Mastodon and way-back-when there was identi.ca, its forerunner . And with social networks, the interest in them is pretty proportional with the availability of the people you want to interact with being on there.That s kind of my point. If we geeks stop jumping on the closed thing, and instead support the alternative open federated decentralised network, then the open network has a chance of gaining the bigger better pool of users.As any tool becomes common, it becomes easier to figure out, because mainstream websites run howto articles understand the network effect. We should apply it for great good!

2017-03-01 15:58:03.000	I did some digging and experimentation, and so far it looks like you could keep a backup bucket in another region and use bidirectional replication 0 to keep the two buckets in sync. If something like this happened again, you could point your app s at the bucket in another region and keep accepting data. The objects would eventually get replicated back to the original bucket, and you could cut over again when service was restored. There does seem to be an appreciable replication lag, so you could run into problems during your cut where some objects had not yet been replicated, but your app ought to handle things like that gracefully anyway. 0

Around here the State Representatives tell people to wipe their arse with Violation Notices they get mailed by companies claiming to have the authority of some barely extant town.So they have a new wrinkle put the automated photography kit in someone s car, and pay them to sit and observe the machinery operate. Somehow this is supposed to serve as the same basis of authority as a publicly sworn peace officer who will be obligated to appear in court.I get that little towns have budget problems and Bubba s brother needs another bass boat, but setting the example of making up and attempting to enforce your own laws like this is a bigger can of worms than they wanted to open.

2018-12-07 02:25:34.000	I disagree that hype leads to the problem you describe. Kubernetes is good at its job, and therefore it s popular, and therefore it s used by people who may not understand it.You could say the exact same thing about Linux, Cisco, Dell, or pretty much any of the popular FOSS projects. Popular things, regardless of their complexity, get chosen by people of all experience levels. Inexperienced people are less likely to properly configure something, regardless of its popularity or hype.If anything, having a few attractive projects tends to be beneficial or at least neutral for security as there are so many more people scrutinizing it, and many more people learning how to properly use it.

2012-12-15 09:12:19.000	I think it is important to learn enum s but it is a bad example. You really should use the built-in types when they re available.

At the bottom end of the scale, you can t yet justify buying software, so a lot of processes are still done manually.It s in the middle that you tend to get squeezed. You re too big to do things on paper, but you don t have the in-house development talent to customize the software to fit your needs.
2018-04-09 20:00:03.000	I want to launch a discussion on the future of software development. It s a fact that front-end development will be deprecated in a near future with tools like Webflow, Squarespace or Wix. This will mean that the future of front-end development will be made by designers or anyone with good sense of style. My question for debate is shouldn t we already have a tool that allowed us to build software on a visual no code matter?A non technical founder that don t want to waste one year learning to code should have tools available to build software without knowing any programming language? Makes sense or is this just utopian?
2023-05-13 03:08:38.000	It seems to me that the prestige of a university is largely a function of it s age. It takes time to become prestigious in the eyes of the public through word of mouth. If you look now at the research universities that are only about 70 years old or less, they are not taken very seriously and are backup schools regardless of the quality of research or instruction going on there. Moreover, some of the prestigious ivy schools have fallen off their game and aren t really top tier in any academic fields anymore, yet are still highly regarded by the general public.

Currently, AWS is the principal cloud service provider but likely later this year there will be others i.e Slice Host, FlexiScale, GoGrid, Sun . Services spanning service providers may include migrations, load balancing and redundancy.It appears to me that RightScale is positioning itself to be a market for cloud computing services. It will be interesting to see if they pull it off.Also, from the description of the monitoring service i.e. no agent required it is likely the monitoring data is collected at the host not the guest OS. So there is probably no process monitoring it follows that application profiling and similar services will not be possible with the data.
2016-08-22 10:00:51.000	This is obviously an area too big to adequately address in a HN comment, but just the broad strokes Spontaneous thoughts that you were referring too, can basically simplifying be seen as the mind s way to avoid certain feelings that it has labeled as bad . For example there can be some situation which you translate into feeling alone only an example , and that feeling is labeled as bad . Every time such situation will happen, that feeling will start to manifest in your system, but the brain will usually very quickly start to think some thoughts in order to distract you from such feeling. For the brain it sounds like a good idea, because there will be less of that bad feeling in your conscioussness, while you think.Now of course, in general, it s not a very good solution, because it only masks a problem. The problem itself is that you don t fully accept and understand all your feelings, and instead are labeling some of them as bad. Additionally to this, if you don t accept the feelings, but instead try to mask them with thoughts - that just makes them grow, because the feelings are not being let out of the system and start living their own lives.What happens during meditation is that you force out all of the thoughts, so that feelings that exist in you become much more clear. You can finally switch your attention to the feelings that have been craving it. Then you become more aligned with them, understand them better and they stop being problematic. Each time you stop meditating - it s just so much more easier to notice that certain thoughts come from feelings, as opposed to just randomly initiate .So it s not really about being aware of the thought process during the meditation, it s more about using the experience gained from meditation, as a reference point, in order to notice deviations from it and how they are experienced.
2022-07-05 16:04:51.000	Let s take your analogy and fix it a bit.There s a guy living on one side of the lake in an area where electricity is cheap. He decides to setup a bitcoin miner in his home. Once he starts making money, he realizes his profit is quite good so he scales up, and scales up, and scales up. Eventually he s drawing so much electricity that it s affecting the whole region and he s cooling his mining rigs with circulated lake water, eventually affecting the local wildlife in the water and around it.Is that ok? After all, 1 rig was fine. What s wrong with 1000 rigs?What s wrong is that there was always an environmental or public cost that was not borne by the person making the profit. When it was a small cost, it wasn t a problem. But now it s a huge cost.
2019-02-18 18:51:56.000	Offtopic, but a couple pages later is the most memorable passage of the whole book to me, a software engineer about setting up the IBM machines to perform calculations for the Manhattan Project Well, Mr Frankel, who started this program, began to suffer from the computer disease that anybody who works with computers now knows about. It s a very serious disease and it interferes completely with the work. The trouble with computers is you play with them. They are so wonderful. ... After a while the whole system broke down. Frankel wasn t paying any attention he wasn t supervising anybody. The system was going very, very slowly-- while he was sitting in a room figuring out how to make one tabulator automatically print arctangent X ... Absolutely useless! We had tables of arc-tangents. But you ve ever worked with computers, you understand the disease-- the delight in being able to see how much you can do. But he got the disease for the first time, the poor fellow who invented the thing. I was asked to stop working on the stuff I was doing in my group and go down and take over the IBM group, and I tried to avoid the disease. I try to keep this in mind when I m working. I must admit I m not very good at avoiding that disease.
2023-03-14 12:35:36.000	For other folks following along and possibly getting mislead by this partial nonsense, I d encourage you to read a blog post I wrote about the topic of unwrap. I think it should clear up most things a meta level, one of the reasons why there is so much focus on unwrap in particular is because it is often the precise point at which in your code where a runtime invariant is broken and thus leads to a panic. Nearly all code has runtime invariants in one form or another. The question is what happens when they re broken. In languages that are memory unsafe by default, the answer is often but not always undefined behavior. In languages like Rust, or Python, or Go, the answer is often but not always the process quits. The reality is more complicated than that, but those are a fine first approximation. For example, breaking a runtime invariant doesn t have to lead to undefined behavior or process termination. It can simply result in a logic error that leads to unexpected behavior.Of course, making the issue more complicated is that sometimes unwrap is abused. And indeed, sometimes it is used in cases where an error ought to be returned. I find this to be generally pretty rare in popular libraries. But the key point here is that you can t just say, oh I see unwrap in a library, so now I m going to scream ABUSE!!!! It s more complicated than that.

E.g. right now the way they solve the problem of collaborating on flashcards is by using _google sheets_ to collect errata on shared decks. This workflow involves manually checking the sheets link, downloading it, converting it to the correct format, importing it into your collection, and hope it doesn t override corrupt your own customizations to a particular card. It s absolutely fucking nuts.I m 100 sure it or something like it is desperately needed by the world. However, students aren t really well known for paying for software, so this remains a nights weekends thing.

2016-01-07 21:07:45.000	Resource Orientation Measure ROM Across all studies, we assessed whether individuals prioritized having more time or having more money by presenting them with a bina ry choice. To help participants imagine these trade-offs concretely and to encourag e honest responding Fisher, 1993 , we asked participants to read a short paragraph des cribing two individuals who prioritize money or who prioritize time in their daily lives. The identities of the characters and the pronouns used in the vignettes were matched to the participant s gender Tina Tom and Maggie Michael for participants who did not repor t identifying as either male or female, the names and pronouns used in the vignettes were d isplayed as gender neutral Madison Taylor . The choices were presented as fol lows Tina values her time more than her money. She is willing to sacrifice h er money to have more time. For example, Tina would rather w ork fewer hours and make less money, than work more hours and make more mone y. Maggie values her money more than her time. She is willing to sacrifice he r time to have more money. For example, Maggie would rathe r work more hours and make more money, than work fewer hours and have mor e time. We chose a binary response format for pragmatic and theoretical reasons. Practically, there is an increased awareness about the importance of conducting research with large representative samples Open Science Col laboration, 2015 . Thus, it is necessary to design short measures that minimize pa rticipant burden while maximizing reliability Nagy, 2002 . Conceptually, we chose th is response format because we were interested in assessing people s broad preferences related to prioritizing time over money, as opposed to assessing people s domain-specific pr eferences.A perhaps laudable measure in order to increase study coherence, but it definitely limits the usefulness of this study in terms of making nuanced life choices.

2017-01-31 10:11:45.000	Probably there s some analog effects going on there that are hard to reproduce mathematically?Yes, exactly. The SID chip is a pretty complex analog synthesizer and it was made using less-than-perfect manufacturing processes, making some chips sound better than others. The SID has very nice analog filters that are not trivial to emulate with digital signal processing. Additionally, there were lots of ugly tricks that abused the SID chip, such as making sounds by emitting a all ones full-blast signal and then cranking the volume of the mixer circuit up and down to produce a fake pcm sound.My best understanding is that a normal audio synthesizer such as this one I believe is doing computation at the same rate as audio output rate typically 44 or 48 kHz . SID software emulators run internally at a much higher sample rate hundreds of kHz in order to emulate the analog circuitry.

Once you ve been working a few years, though, your degree matters much less to potential employers.One way second-tier universities can get around this problem is through mandatory co-op and internship programs. Push students to explore the job market early on, and they ll start their post-grad job search with confidence, a stronger resume, and a network of contacts from previous co-ops and internships. This network may even include students from elite universities, who funnily enough often end up in the same internships and entry-level roles as their less-pedigreed counterparts.

Injecting American ID pol onto non-Amercian cultures is incredibly toxic and colonial. The reason the whole idea of color and whiteness was presented was to answer the question of why did people remove the color from the objects and why wasn t it common knowledge about how they were actually painted objects.This has been common knowledge for a long time - this article isn t really about that once you actually read through it. Political against Alt-RightFacts have nothing to do with the Alt-Right they don t tend to like them, however using other people s history to take a shot at different political groups is gross it doesn t matter what side you re on.

2015-11-20 00:21:52.000	Not specifically tcp_collapse, but the article theorizes that some memory management done by tcp_collapse i.e. GC is the cause. I d place my bets on memory calls being the cause too.But... they never went to the next step and confirmed that tcp_collapse was making lengthy system memory calls. They kind of gloss over the details of why reducing rmem alleviates the problem.Is it because with smaller rmem tcp_collapse aggregates segments into smaller sk_buffs, and these smaller-size memory calls don t take as long to return?Or is it because tcp_collapse has less memory stitching to do, since it can t fit as many segments into the smaller sk_buffs?

To make the over used car analogy, this is if you were to replace the engine on a brand new car you bought with a different one, only to have the car destroy itself, and the new engine you just put in it.It s one thing to not support the new engine when it has problems. It s another thing to destroy property that someone bought from you after the sale if they use it in a way you don t approve.I understand it costs more to support an open platform. But it s a choice to support that open platform, and Motorola doesn t have to do that, they can hang up on Joe Average who did installs the mod just like a dealership would do so on anyone who screwed up putting a completely different engine in their brand new car.
2014-04-01 13:07:17.000	coolsebz, I felt the same way when I was in college. A year and a half in I dropped out. Like you I also programmed for fun at a young age and loved the pleasure it gave me. The ability to create something on my own from virtually nothing was incredibly exciting. Once I found out I could also make money I was hooked.When I dropped out I started a company that failed horribly in the first year. However, in that year I networked with other small business owners and entrepreneurs in the area. From these connections I was able to work my way from one startup to the next. Six years later I now working with a more traditional corporate company and live comfortably.Like any journey in life it came with a great set of experiences that I learned from that formed who I am today. However, I wouldn t say that dropping out of college was the best idea I ever had. Had I attempted to apply for the corporate job that I am in now when I dropped out I would have never got it. It took a backlog of personal opensource projects, a positive track record at previous companies, and a good deal of networking. Having a degree wouldn t have been a guarantee at getting in either -- but it would have gotten me past HR faster.Life is a crazy journey, and I understand wanting to run as fast as possible. If I was you, I would use college as an opportunity to work on your own ideas and projects, learn, network, explore yourself, and have fun. Even if it doesn t seem like it, you have a lot of time ahead of you. This time in your live is an amazing opportunity to live and explore without boundaries.

2016-08-23 21:38:08.000	The annual pay raise died a few decades ago.AFAICT, despite the hype, it really didn t, it just became less significant. You can go back and re-read early issues of FastCompany, from the 1990s, where they talk about you the worker needs to make themselves essential to the company, because annual raises are dead and only real promotions bring real money any more.Its true that in private industry, reliable annual increases that are much greater than inflation and so represent real advancement are far less common than they used to be. They still happen in some places where people advance within broad pay bands without a change of position or title, so it isn t strictly the case that all real significant pay increases come from promotions, but its not a bad approximation.But even so, annual nominal pay increases that are at least near or slightly higher than inflation seem to remain common in private industry.

2019-02-08 19:46:38.000	This part of the video makes no sense. I didn t watch the rest. From the video If you observe milk protein casein under a microscope it will appears as this - there are 17 links in it.The video says links , you say rings . It s a small but important distinction. Proteins are made by linked aminoacids, so sing link is a good approximation, but most of them don t look like rings .I can t find where the 17 comes from. After a few google searches I found that casein has approximately 210 aminoacids, the number can vary, but it is not 17. Also, you can t see a single casein protein under a normal microscope, nor the parts of it. I guess it s only a metaphor, but it makes me suspicious. I don t find the part in the video that says that casein escapes to blood. I didn t try too hard. Casein is split in the stomach by the enzymes IIRC they are the regular enzymes that also split the proteins in meat, and other food, not specialized enzymes. There is an specialized enzyme for lactose that is an special sugar in milk, but this is not what the video or you say. But if this were dangerous, we d have a lot of babies with diabetes. Moreover, only some adults produce the enzyme to digest lactose, so it would be easy to test. I didn t find a source that says that beta cells have some proteins that are similar to casein. It is posible, but I doubt.And IIRC most autoinmune diseases, where the body get confused and start to attack some part of it don t go away after you remove the initial agent that causes the reaction. So stopping drinking milk won t stop the reaction.

I ve told this story a million times, but here it goes again I was once in Puno in Peru, at the shore of lake Titicaca. It s a famous tourist attraction, where indigenous I loathe that word people used to live on floating islands made out of reed. The story that is portrayed to the tourists is that they still do as happens with many of that sort of travels, I was surrounded by obnoxious embrace other cultures idiots who were saying how great it was that these people still lived like they used to, and how much better it would be if we in the West would also do so, and how authentic it all was.Well, we were on the first boat of the day, and along with us rode a bunch of indigenous people with reed skirts who had missed their boat to the island 45 minutes earlier, because they were living in Puno in a proper house where their kids could play soccer and where they didn t have to fear at night that the very house they and their children were sleeping in would sink from right under them. While a bunch of rich white assholes disclaimer I m white and by most global standards fairly rich, I guess, although I think that most of the time I m not an asshole were proclaiming how authentic living on a reed boat was, these people who were actually living that life decided that they would get out of it as soon as they could.

If there are too many change requests, even if they re sensible and make sense, things will slip through the cracks. If there s the need for multiple checks by the reviewer, even more things will slip through the cracks.Also, breaking up PRs in frontend vs backend is not the best idea. Build the feature iteratively if possible.EDIT Since the grandparent is talking about reviewing by commit if those are more reviewable, just use those as the way to separate PRs instead, maybe?

They can be written in any language. Event Calculus happens to be a Turing complete programming language.

2017-02-03 14:25:58.000	I sympathize with them more than I used to. I attended a meeting of the Linux Standard Base working group back when systemd was truly awful compared to it s current state, and the main item on the agenda from employees of the other major Linux companies was how they were going to force Debian Ubuntu to go along with systemd so LSB didn t have to shrink their scope or not apply to them. I no longer blame them for not wanting to play politics to be part of a community like that. I don t really like Ubuntu s style personally anymore, but for what they re trying to do, going with everyone else s solutions is probably a good thing to avoid.

2011-10-23 13:12:13.000	Indeed it is. Upon my realization that I should try harder to disqualify you, Edit timer has already passed.So I will offer my clarification here.This notion, that somehow in Eastern Block everybody had their basic needs covered in an egalitarian fashion while in Western Capitalism, to get any kind of fair? treatment one better be lined with cash is sorely mistaken.In reality Eastern Block was very much as your average 1 99 scenario. The ruling elite Cream of various Party organization and their relatives had it all doctors, money, travel, education,... .If an unprivileged person wanted some of the services that were reserved for the Party elite - one would have to pay bribes all the way to destination.Average folk didn t get any meaningful service level on security, education, health,...So basically the only difference between East and West is was that in West you don t have as high probability of being imprisoned killed have property confiscated while trying to go about doing business.Furthermore in regards to Yuri - his parents were obviously well liked by the regime high, excellent positions which enabled them lucrative careers and lifestyles.In Soviet Russia - you didn t get to travel round the world and do business - unless Regime could be certain that you can be trusted e.g. are a part of the system .p.s. For reference check Northern Korea, whats going on there was pretty much the golden standard for socialist regimes.

There are plenty of folks like me who can t dev but are able to grow businesses, you just have to find the right one that fits the channel your customers hang around in and you enjoy talking with.One of my partners and I talk all day every day, we met on some random subreddit and three years in he s one of my closest friends and we have quite successfully generated ARRThe side benefit of this is it allows you to focus on what you re good at which is building the product.I don t have capacity but I could probably connect you with some potential people if you d like or at least willing to talk through some potential marketing thoughts with you if you d like to talk.

2018-10-06 03:28:24.000	One example of when generating from source can make for a less than ideal experience is the Monaco editor s documentation 0 .- Most modules don t have intro sections to guide you to where you might want to start looking for the most common tasks. You have to guess the kinds of names they might have chosen for the given tasks. Turns out customizing syntax highlighting is mainly done with setMonarchTokensProvider and not setTokensProvider.- Many methods or classes have redundant docstrings, like how setLanguageConfiguration 1 says Set the editing configuration for a language or setTheme says Switches to a theme. - To find out what you can do with instances of a code editor, you don t click monaco.editor in the right sidebar like I kept thinking. Instead, you d click the create method on that page, and click through to its return type, which is actually IStandaloneCodeEditor.- The search field only searches on exact prefixes of the basename. This isn t exactly a generate-from-code problem but a typedoc UI issue that led me to just download the code and use search-in-project instead within VS Code ironically enough .Fortunately, for the most common tasks, the Monaco playground 2 and Monarch playground 3 were helpful in pointing me to the right direction. So that offsets some of these annoyances. But I actually switched away from generating bland documentation via typeoc for my app, and started using a custom documentation generator that allows me to structure my app s docs in a way that is more human-friendly. 0

Same for Russia report. Recently the government has been sued for handing out multi-billion contracts to pals without challenge, and obviously they immediately reached out for the secrets act.We are sensitive about private data, because if you believe in a right to remain silent, well, now you can t stay silent.Evem if you are innocent, spurrious charges can ruin you financially.

2022-09-07 02:09:12.000	One of the tradeoffs to building dense is that it makes it harder to decentralize the grid.The other side of that is that with dense living, people need dramatically less energy to begin with. Less energy for heating and cooling, and far less energy to transportation if they live close to wherever they go and can just walk there.

2019-10-01 15:03:23.000	From another perspective Whilst I am likely to spend far more time documenting than coding in my work, when I build something at home to fix a problem just for me I m far less likely because it s for me.In the case of this particular developer, it isn t just for themselves, but also in a different language, and they ve done their best just to reflect an existing API. They ve asked for pull requests.I can understand not wanting to do the enormous amount of work of translating an API that is already pretty-much documented when I won t really see any return at all.

2022-04-12 17:28:20.000	btw to be clear, I don t think that the increase in money supply has had zero impact. I think it s actually a key part. Folks saved a bunch of money - to your point, invested it in the stock market - and then when restrictions lifted, they went out and bought stuff. This spike in demand contributed to inflation, no doubt, and it was in part created by new money. I m not sure that the alternative - at least from the Fed s perspective - of allowing the US to enter a deflationary spiral in 2020 would have done us better.I also think that these issues are transient, and caused by a very poor transition out of COVID lockdowns and into normalcy. It s taking longer than I thought to resolve, but I do think that not taking too much dramatic action and letting the market sort it out is the path forward.

2017-12-19 20:44:34.000	I m going to write in good faith, I hope to be read as such.Firstly, you have not responded at all to my comment on your comment. A sensible and worthwhile discussion may come out of addressing those observations.Secondly, crimes are in the eye of the judge, but as the accused perpetrator holding my own council, referring to your role in Google and your legal training was a kind of awe. I am a game theorist the bridge between my applied mathematics and macroeconomics careers and so I am well aware of the importance of signalling and posturing. I fully expect that a lawyer, schooled and practiced in the manner of approaching a debate, is equally attuned to how what is said and what is not said. The game theorist in me saw something closely resembling strategic pre-positioning, and entirely without second aims, I called it out for what it looked like. That is not character assassination in my eyes but just a tiny bit of critical reading of your prose.If you really want your employer to be left out of this, you can signal that to us all by removing any references to Google on your already impressive profile. Or perhaps leave the reference to Google but also ad something to the effect of leave my employer out of this .Anyway, returning to the main argument I doubt any internet behemoth can afford to pull out of the EU and lose access to 740 million affluent consumers because they d instantly lose revenue that would ruin their bottom line while also giving local European companies a neo terra nullis to develop their products experimenting on their captive audience until they are ready to take the fight back to the behemoths home turf.The internet blue-chips hate being excluded from anywhere because whenever they are excluded from somewhere their revenue drops and some new competitor starts to simmer.

2024-02-15 15:43:17.000	When they say all the data in Erlang Elixir is immutable, it does not mean that there is no state. There s definitely data in the programs that change values, because like you point out, how in the heck can you write a useful system that doesn t have any state anywhere?State or data that changes values is typically put in one of 3 different places 1. On the stack. It s pretty typical to have a function like handle_message app_state, request . The current state of the app is in the call parameters. At the end of this message, handle_call would call itself again with the new updated state. Somewhere else in the system we keep track of the last value of that state, and if handle_call crashes, we just use the last state.2. Another place to hold state is in external storage somewhere.3. The third main place to hold state is via references to other objects, which do 1 or 2 above.Regarding whether there is a difference between messaging local versus remote objects-- there s an operator for sending messages to another object. It works the same for local and remote. I think it s possible to inspect the actor address and see where it is, but the mechanism works the same.

2024-06-10 04:30:56.000	While you may be able to create amazing experiences in JavaScript, JavaScript still has multiple problems 1. It is inconsistent 1 2. It does not have many features that programmers love and other languages have.3. It has a community that holds different values from what other programmers value themselves.If people want to continue development in JavaScript, they can. But since JavaScript has a monopoly on the fairly large frontend development for the web market, there will always be attempts to find an alternative. 1

2014-10-16 13:55:20.000	I notice your use of scare quotes. Is the state of the art advanced enough to make a judgement on whether or not a person is better at the genetic level than another person? I m not just talking about some specific category or skill, but also as a well-rounded person. Because these people will have to live their own lives, and would be subject to whatever other traits that might arise when you try to optimize humans for some kind of skill. I at least don t think that the state of the art is so advanced that they can predict that optimizing for some specific trait might have some unforeseen consequences when it comes other, perhaps seemingly unrelated traits.

2019-02-05 19:59:13.000	I think it s particularly important for Uber because their typical first-time user has an immediate need and is away from home. If the app takes too long to download over cellular data or random airport WiFi then they ve likely lost a customer to the competition.

We are, on the whole, less violent now than we were through most of our history, and there is reason to hope this will continue.

2021-09-03 06:51:44.000	Soros figuratively speaking, although I would not be surprised - good ol George tends to have his fingers in a lot of pies worldwide, and this is a tasty one. Navalny had to declare himself and his fund as foreign agent because he took funding from abroad. Which is OK under Russian law, as long as you always state you re a foreign agent this is required by law if someone writes about you in the news for example .It d be strange, I think you ll agree, to run for the top political office in the country after doing that. But even if he did run, he would not get anything above single digit percentage of support, basically some particularly liberal part of liberal elite in Moscow and Saint Petersburg.I think a lot of people myself included sympathise with his anti-corruption work, even though it has zero effect. But even the sympathizers know that politically he has zero prospects in any high level election there even if everything was fair and square which it is not . The West, on the other hand, is gaslit into believing that he s Putin s arch-nemesis or something, and Putin is losing any sleep over his existence or activity. As they say in Russia as a dog barks, the caravan goes on.Here s another thing people in the West don t know about him he s a nationalist and a xenophobe he shares that with most Russian people, but he s considerably more extreme in his views , but I wonder if his curators from USAID know that. Here he is in 2011 speaking from the stage at a nationalist Russian March To US folks, this is like Charlottesville, but without the opposing side. Jews will not replace us and everything. Plenty of skinheads in the crowd. You only don t see swastikas there because they re illegal to show in Russia.So TL DR Navalny is a complicated man at best. And he s not, and will never be Putin s rival .

2014-10-06 09:01:15.000	Yet it s good to acknowledge that a small number of companies like Google, Facebook and Twitter are in practice controlling the media consumption of a large growing amount of people. They have the power to make fine tuned adjustements in how people perceive the world.It s fully voluntary and people gladly do it because it s so convenient. I don t think that the majority of people will ever perform their searches on multiple search engines to compare their results, in the same way they might buy two different newspapers or watch two different TV news broadcasts.So I think it s a completely new kind of monopoly on worldview, and that the old rules and approaches on dealing with anticompetitive behaviour won t work.
2013-08-07 16:23:08.000	Constitutions were not the solution to the problem. An educated and engaged electorate was the solution. The Constitution was a framework for that electorate to use as a tool, but several of the founders were very clear that the essential requirement of effective government was the engaged and educated electorate.James Madison The advancement and diffusion of knowledge is the only guardian of true liberty. Knowledge will forever govern ignorance, and a people who mean to be their own governors, must arm themselves with the power knowledge gives. Learned institutions ought to be favorite objects with every free people. They throw that light over the public mind which is the best security against crafty and dangerous encroachments on the public liberty. Thomas Jefferson Every government degenerates when trusted to the rulers of the people alone. The people themselves, therefore, are its only safe depositories. And to render them safe, their minds must be improved to a certain degree. Above all things I hope the education of the common people will be attended to convinced that on their good sense we may rely with the most security for the preservation of a due degree of liberty. I know no safe depository of the ultimate powers of the society, but the people themselves and if we think them not enlightened enough to exercise their controul with a wholsome discretion, the remedy is, not to take it from them, but to inform their discretion by education. this is the true corrective of abuses of constitutional power.
2023-03-17 22:26:22.000	Yes, but there s also an element of pervase incentive related to safety adding to it. There was an additional regulation put in some time ago regarding hood design, such that pedestrians have a crumple zone above the engine block. The correct way to solve this was mount the engine lower and slope the hood more, but auto manufacturers decided to just jack up the whole frontal facade instead, defeating the whole purpose. I m not arguing against having this regulation btw, there are worse out there, it s just interesting is all

2016-01-14 19:34:07.000	It s interesting that you posit that the ultimate endgame is corporate-friendly content . I was curious why you think that content is heading that way? Every company I ve seen eventually goes this way. When a corporation becomes large enough, they start answering to special interest groups on the left right and self-censoring content as to not tarnish the reputation of investors or lose valuable market share. If anything, I d argue that globalizing Netflix combined with stronger control over their own original content enables Netflix to move towards an endgame where lots of niche audiences are served rather than only mass markets . At CES, Ted Sarandos VP of Content mentioned that traditional TV had to hit home runs all the time, while Netflix can score with singles, double, etc. Why would Netflix jeopardize this advantage and hop in the time machine to become an outdated TV company? I hope you re right. So far, they are copying the cable company strategy license older content to get the viewers and then eventually create your own content to make more money. It s a pretty good business strategy, if you can pull it off.When the Syfy I actually hate this name channel first came out, it was all old episodes of Quantum leap, Star Trek, and lost in space. They slowly built their own content over the years and now pretty much only have original content.It s also tends to happen with monopolies if this ever happens to Netflix . Right now, they are taking tons of chances and it s hit miss which means some fantastic content for customers .When you are on top, your strategy changes to what has worked. You don t want to lose market share, which means taking less chances. You aren t desperately trying to gain market share, you are now holding onto it. So, we might still see cool content, but it won t be as groundbreaking or as often.I feel like this eventually gets watered down enough, and big money advertisers get involved, and the cycle repeats.I was an avid XM radio fan from the beginning. Many of the shock-jocks were allowed to say and do pretty much anything. After the big merger, it s now a shell of what it once was the same strategy as the radio industry. If you compare the jocks of the 90s and today, it s a much different landscape .I absolutely love the explosion of podcasts in the last couple of years. It has given people the complete freedom of speech and has pretty much replaced what I loved about satellite radio.It reminds me why a free Internet is so important.

2013-06-01 00:44:14.000	Interesting piece, and reinforces my belief that branding is everything . That includes the company name, the design of the product and overall design language and the kind of marketing that you do.One thing I disagree on is the name choice in the case of August. Customers face so much input and distractions that I wouldn t advise anyone to name their company in a mysterious way that will provoke any kind of curiosity in the customer. Most will just skip your product. This one time it works because of the guy behind the company and the coverage he s getting, but I wouldn t count on this branding working outside of the tech circle and the early adopters which constituted the 10k of orders. The design is very good though, while Lockitron s is the definition of lazy design just copy an Apple design and be done .I particularly liked the author s comparison between GoPro and Contour. I admire GoPro s branding. The name is perfect it creates the association between buying the product and becoming a pro, which is brilliant , the marketing is perfect and even the product packaging and store display is perfect. This is executed on an Apple level. Very few companies are this good on their branding. It all comes together to a feel good product .
2021-04-18 10:11:21.000	The pricing structure especially baffles me. My house is worth about 300.

2021-11-23 18:09:42.000	I agree that is happening more often in the initial stages. And with a bit of experience reputation you can command very favorable terms in the early stages of a start-up, at least in the present climate where seed type funding is relatively very easy to come by.Or let s say you don t have much money and you want to avoid early VC due to loss of control and hefty dilution. In the US market, move to a college town often quite safe , take a part-time 15 hr retail job CVS and Walgreens are both moving to that minimum in 2022 both are better than fast food and easier than Walmart type jobs , get a modest cost apartment 650- 750 , walk bus bike to work no car expenses , keep your bills under 1k- 1.2k per month, build your start-up on Hetzner new Virginia datacenter . Self-fund, build your thing, don t take early venture capital, maximize your leverage later on. Maybe occasionally do some side contracting work if necessary to fill up the personal treasury 10 hr per month or less .The counter argument to that is primarily the speed angle, get bigger faster or get crushed by the VC funded crowd, and similar arguments. It likely varies by the case as to whether a given approach makes more sense or less eg depending on what you re building, time to market may not be so much of the essence, or it may be critical .

I m probably 20-30 body fat. Heck, maybe more. I ve put 5,000 miles on a normal bicycle in one year, including a 130 mile ride in one single day on a mountain bike. I bicycle commute year round in Kansas City. This time of year I ride to the bus stop 5-7 miles round trip depending on my schedule and which buses I take but quite often, I do the whole round trip by bike alone, which is 29 miles per day. I ve driven to work once in the last 2 years. Almost all of my riding is for basic transportation, so I m not one of those spandex-clad weekend-mile superheroes. I m not fast, either. It s just efficient, and it makes sense most of the time. If I can do it without electric assist, pretty much anyone can.That said, there s this whole I m Going Green ! thing going on. And it s not that that s a bad thing either. Efficiency, sustainability and stewardship are great things.This new wheel, however, actually makes the bike human machine less efficient. It may have enough gee-whiz factor to get people to ride, but the chances of those people throwing their new hybrid-wheeled-bike onto the roof rack of their Hummer H2 and driving 3 miles to the nearest multi-use-path trailhead are probably rather high. I have my doubts it ll get many people to drive less and ride more.
2020-09-24 11:24:33.000	I agree totally it is a privacy minefield but proofs of ID are already required by many institutions that have far less resources than tech giants. In Poland for example where I m from , the National ID is required in all sorts of situations, both online and otherwise.Also, I never meant to suggest proof of ID would be mandatory to use the service! It would be an additional status you can get optionally, if you want to get extra credibility. If you desire anonymity instead, that should absolutely be your right.At the moment, you can get a checkmark on your twitter but how you do it is a bit unclear. Technically you have to be somewhat noteworthy, but the bar seems to be really low. If this was an entirely user-initiated process, over time people would associate that status with higher credibility.

2020-02-12 19:44:03.000	First of all, the popular empty-city story is made up by the author of Romance of Three Kingdom. It actually was Zhao Yan, a general in the same faction as ZhuGe Liang, who pretended to have an empty fortress and repelled an attack. Needless to say, there is no truth whatsoever to alternative truth that drama speculated.Second, by the time Sima Yi commanded a large field army, Cao Cao had died for a long time. Sima Yi represented powerful large land-owners who would gain monopoly on official positions during Cao Pi s reign, Cao Cao s son. It is a recipe for weakening imperial authority and endangering emperors. Historians argue that Cao Cao passed up the chance to become emperor because he would not countenance such policy.Third, that TV show is like so much of Chinese TV that is a wasteland. It is melodramatic, ludicrous, and laughably bad acting. I am sorry, but it is unwatchable, not just the show, even the trailer. Compare the stylized combat and bloodletting to the realism of Game of Throne yes, I am ware of the irony of calling historical drama fake and fantasy real there is no comparison. Nothing there is believable, much like every word out of CCP s mouth. It is sad, really.

Others are probably a bit harder to market as restaurant fare e.g. acorn mush, bird brain stew, Indian ice cream . Some of it is also very specific to certain tribes or otherwise has a more regional than national appeal e.g. succotash, hominy .I definitely agree with you that restaurants specializing in traditional American Indian cuisine whether in general or with an emphasis on a specific tribe or tribes would be a great idea.

2017-08-20 05:55:35.000	Some issues I had with the JS criticisms Many of the examples seemed really contrived. Yes, JS lets you overwrite methods for specific instances which e.g. can be useful for testing and assign to array indexes way outside the existing bounds, but I haven t seen either of those cause problems for people. The author repeatedly complains about missing features that would only make sense in a language with a type system. Many popular languages used by professionals are dynamic-typed. It s a legitimate way to do programming, and sacrifices safety in favor of flexibility. And just like how most static-typed languages compile to a dynamic-typed target language usually assembly , JS has two good static type systems TypeScript and Flow that compile down to JS in the same way. Many of the criticisms apply to many programming languages, and I expect someone comfortable with a few programming languages wouldn t find them too surprising when learning JS. Examples reference values, implicit exceptions, IEEE floating point edge cases, blockless if , switch fallthrough. And many of the examples are disallowed by the default configuration of eslint, which basically everyone uses. The criticism of ES2016 seemed really disingenuous, and ignored the vast majority of the progress made to the language in that year. There just happened to only be two features that year that crossed the finish line to make it into the spec. ES2015 and ES2017 were both much more significant, and the JS committee meets regularly and is actively working on about 50 different proposals simultaneously.That said, some of the criticisms of JavaScript were certainly legitimate, like the map parseInt example and the null undefined issue although it still is a meaningful distinction that s occasionally useful .

I don t think it snobbish inversely or otherwise for me to think that this is a sad squandering of resource and a more than slightly horrid aspect of the human character.I don t see how people making fine watches is a squandering of resources . It s also not obvious why you are attributing this horrid aspect only to a stereotypical rich person.Surely wearing a football shirt, cutting the labels of your clothes, wearing a chairman Mao suit, or a pair of Nike sneakers are all signalling status in one way or another.Why are these things ok and watches are not? Why are expensive baubles more worthy of sneering than cheap ones?

I certainly didn t know there are tags in tires which, BTW, is a nifty idea , and there are doubtless hundreds of other tracks I leave. Who could possibly cover them all? It would be like trying to make a sieve water-tight, except you don t even know where half the holes are!Now, if we re talking about the NSA and not mobsters, and you are less concerned with being un-findable than you are with hiding your activities- there are different games you can play, and I d bet you could be more successful. Behave in an ordinary fashion 99.9 of the time. Just look at the intelligence operations sixty years ago. Spies didn t hide in holes so no-one could find them, they blended in.

The request handler could do an expensive 2-hours operation that uses 100 of a core for all we know. That s up to the web programmer to optimize.The http-lib programmer, on the other hand, should optimize, and give data, for exactly what it does, nothing more, and nothing less.People seem to conflate those responsibilities all the time when they see a benchmark. A http-parser benchmark s role is not to tell you how fast your app will serve.

Prostate cancer is the opposite The government used to screen for it PSA blood test and so people would see their doctor at stage 1 or 2 cancer, when it can be easily tested. But the problem was that the positivity rate was about 45 1, and the test is too expensive at that scale. So now PSA tests are not routine. As a result, people are now coming in to their doctors with prostate cancer at stage 3 or 4. Might be the right choice for society, but the wrong choice for the individual.

2022-10-04 10:17:28.000	1. Not a lot of work, probably a day to move things. 2. Almost none. I used Heroku and understood what it was doing on a very surface level. I knew I could push my repo and my project would automagically be there , but since I was early on in my learning process, I didn t know for sure what was happening. So the migration was a great experience to understand how to setup my website, how to setup a reverse proxy, how to prepare the certificates, how to secure a linux box and many many more it s an ongoing process! 3. Extremely. I am now a huge supporter of IAAS in general. I think all the things I learned are valuable in general and widely applicable. I know what an lsblk does, I know what ufw allow deny does and so on. Hell, at the most basic level I understand how to use nano to edit some config files, how to search or edit files from a terminal. I really enjoy it and I went as far as to setup my own home server. 4-5. A lot cheaper now. I had one website running and another hobby project and that was 7 a month. I have my website now static page with caddy as reverse proxy , pihole vps, another VPS used to do backup checks, VPN server - all these are free, except the website which runs on the cheapest Hetzner vps and I could probably run other things on it. 6. I think everyone should spend some time deploying their apps o a remote server, securing it and accessing it. Even if you never use this again, it will help you understand how to manage all of these things and get a better idea of the information flow from start to finish. Learning how to poke around a command line is also very helpful.

If someone casually asks whatcha doing? , you should never answer nothing . Deliberately playing a game isn t doing nothing, taking a nap isn t doing nothing. Social media isn t necessarily doing nothing, but for me it usually is.Ask yourself, did I decide to do this? What is my goal? If your goal is passing time, stop.

This way you could squeeze the context window even more.I have written some stories myself, with the help of GPT, i will try to parse my stories with your method. It is very interesting.As a side note, GPT is definitely not a toy. I use it for coding, it is great! I use it to write command line apps, which do some simple data manipulation, some more complex than others, but in the order of hundreds of lines of code. They work flawlessly, without me writing even a single line of code.

2023-07-16 08:22:08.000	Uric acid is a normal body waste product. It forms when chemicals called purines break down. Purines are a natural substance found in the body. They are also found in many foods, such as liver, shellfish, and alcohol. They can also be formed in the body when DNA is broken down. quick search determines that the main source of uric acid are dietary sources and that there are factors that might make its clearance slower. Fructose, if it s a significant factor, is down there in the list of things that should be checked

2021-12-09 00:03:12.000	Quote from reviewed book in link a bedrock and simplistic assumption that has long shackled the charitable world that money spent on direct services is the only worthy use of charitable funds, while money invested in organizational effectiveness is to be kept as close to zero as possible. It is an equation widely accepted by the donating public, by the press, by charity watchdogs, by government regulators, and by most charities themselves. To keep overhead costs down, charities forgo necessary investments with devastating and sometimes deadly results. There are a lot of parasitic organisations that provide shitty expensive advice consultancy services to crappy charities. A sort of web of symbiotic parasites, helping charities to provide no value. It is no surprise that crappy charities can spend a ton of money on organisational effectiveness that only return negative value overall.

When applying for large companies with HR departments I ve found they don t really get read because piles of CVs are what gets passed around, but I know for a fact my cover letter is what got me into the interview for both the early stage startups I ve worked for - when you re starting as developer number 1 or 2 founders really care about who they re hiring, and a good cover letter is what allows you to frame the CV in light of the company. For example my current job is with a company that does IoT based home security - a skim of my CV at the time would have been completely unimpressive in that context, but the cover letter allowed me to go into some detail about the fact I ve been done home automation and electronics as a hobby since before I even had a job.

The local workers just happen to be brown and born in a different place.The money will still be spent in your own economy. The choices are threefold My preferred scheme 1 Low income taxpayers keep 30k and spend it themselves. Government pays for 70k from lowest bidding software engineer possibly an Indian .Fergie s preferred scheme 2 Low income taxpayers don t get to spend 30k on themselves. Government pays 100k to a non-Indian software engineer.My alternate scheme 3 Low income taxpayers don t get to spend 30k on themselves. Government pays 70k to some Indian software engineer and then gives 30k to some random high income non-Indian person.Your argument does not distinguish between 2 and 3 . In both cases, money is transferred from taxpayers to high income colocated workers who will presumably spend it in the economy.

2023-05-28 23:32:51.000	That s actually what I meant we don t know . But it seems that many people think that superintelligent AIs will enter a positive feedback of improvement getting to something incomprehensible, something the article is an argument against BTW.But the naive interpretation of this leads to a singularity, and the fact it leads to a singularity shows that that interpretation is wrong and that there should be a limiting factor somewhere, the article suggests some of them.As for the black hole, it is hard to argue using that analogy since you don t want to get close to a black hole for very well known reasons unrelated to the singularity, but let s get into sci-fi mode and say you could, it may be risky but it may also be worth it. The thing is from the point of view of the travailler, you never cross the event horizon, and you get to know what s inside the black hole as the event horizon recedes from you, maybe you will never get back, but maybe there are greater things in there. And we are already trapped anyways as we are going one way through time, just as in black holes, things go one way through space, so maybe it is a risk worth taking.

2014-01-21 04:03:46.000	I completely disagree with both assertions.1. On the idea that somehow technical debt is culturally ingrained in certain societies.Silicon Valley is filled with countless programmers who continually drum the ship the shit out philosophy. If you haven t worked there, a rough sample of this forum s blog posts by clueless founders should indicate that.I have worked in enough American run American programmer driven companies to know that technical debt is not an abstraction. It is a reality that is reflected by programmer pressures.So it is not culture specific unless the culture you are talking about is programmer culture.2. On the idea that western programmers care more about discipline rather than smarts.Programming interviews as evidenced by personal experience and the realms of rants written online are a perfect reflector of the fallacy of that assertion. How the fuck is writing depth first search or some other bullshit graph search algorithm in 2 minutes any sign that you are a good programmer to design an iOS app?

So any supposed collusion isn t really helping them. If you re with a reputable company and took the time to set up your policy optimally, your auto insurance ends up being about as good a deal as you re going to get anywhere. FYI, the real steak and potatoes in that industry is life insurance policies. They can make more on that than anything else combined.

So one possible universe is that Boeing the corporation fails, and the government rescues it and makes it an actual government owned enterprise.

I personally found it helpful doing weekly check-ins and having people holding me accountable to my goals.Unfortunately, the stigma regarding men sharing feelings is prevalent in western society, and it s not only the men causing it.

2020-06-29 16:41:06.000	that s why i included the bit about the skew built into the gdp itself, but the larger point is that the correlation is so macro-broad that it s loaded with all sorts of confounding factors.if we want both high and growing gdp and fertility over replacement, we need more economic fairness, particularly around wealth and income, which has all sorts of unintuitive distorting effects. that requires capital to be loosed from captive greed and spread more broadly and deeply into the economy.immigration in place of high reproduction is fine too for growth, which is one of the points of the article.you can t get prosperity and choke off sources of activity and innovation, which is what the US and similar is doing. those in power, along with the lower classes clinging to the scraps of privilege trickled down to them, want neither economic fairness nor immigration because it potentially dilutes their power and influence, others be damned.they d rather have most of a smaller pie the current situation than a proportionally-smaller but absolutely-bigger piece of a bigger pie the zero-sum thinking . that s the conundrum in a nutshell.

Most services still rely on g.711 - essentially uncompressed voice - for transmission of fax tones. However there is no guarantee the end to end call will be g.711 even if specified during call setup. There is an app called eFax - unfortunately the service is not free but I as a subscriber routinely fax over the phone when it s the only way to communicate like with a doc office .
2023-05-31 16:15:07.000	PhD student in STEM here I think most people have the wrong idea about what peer review is. My advisor teaches us to treat it as a first check, but it is not a guarantee of correct results.Most of the time I spend on research is actually trying to understand the literature and reproducing their results. If I can t do it, it probably means I don t understand enough about the work I m reading, but there is also the small chance that the published analysis is wrong, which already happened to me.EDIT typo.
2022-08-24 11:06:38.000	your implementation would be more prone to scammy content farmers e.g. spammers using trials locale pricing arbitrage to play only one SCAM_ARTIST song per account .Wat? You re saying that if you misimplement it and count all users including free trial as equal paying you could get problematic incentives? Well, yeah. The point is today you have correctly implemented per-stream and there is a massive open arbitrage. A bot account can control 100-1000x of revenue compared to a human. Most importantly, however, your model is just not how memberships work in the real world. ... Spotify doesn t produce music, they act as middle man between you and the artists you listen to. There s a reasonable expectation that Spotify takes a cut between you and the artists you listen to, similar to an app store. Splitting your contribution between the artists you re listening to makes sense and importantly does not have arbitrage for content farm spammers modulo a tiny bit of value from stolen accounts .HBO and Costco aren t just funneling money around, they re producing physical goods and content, so it doesn t apply directly. You could make a more convoluted argument that they should follow the same principles but it s really not clear what that would mean, so I m not gonna defend it. Same with taxes, I don t know what either per-stream or per-customer would even map to in that space.

It d be easier to maintain and clean the filter systems - to me that seems easier and more effective. It could be an addition to filter systems in the ocean.
2022-06-17 08:14:53.000	That s a fair point.

I d prefer it be done that way rather than internal activists pushing their own beliefs onto the company unilaterally and disrupting operations - that s one way we can be SURE our tax dollars would be wasted.
2018-03-15 01:37:36.000	Aside from the lessened intensity of the main shock, distance saves you from even feeling many of the aftershocks.During LP, my then-pregnant sister lived in Aptos less than one mile from the epicenter. They were getting meaningful aftershocks by the dozens through the evening.The surface waves were amazing directional. I was at work when it hit, and we had those suspended, noise-absorbing foam panels in the ceiling... and you could see the rippling of the surface wave propagate along the ceiling.Those bookshelves cabinets, dressers and other tallish rectangular objects that were perpendicular to the wave fell over those parallel to it tended to be fine.Almost everywhere along El Camino from Menlo to the Sunnyvale border had power outages, with one exception a half-block of El Camino just north of Grant. Yet that half-block just happened to have a gas station and a 24-hour restaurant where Los Charros is now that remained up and running throughout.

2023-07-11 22:06:14.000	And the thing is, latency can be good enough for some games. I tried out the top end tier of GeForce NOW for a month just to see what it was like since I ve always been skeptical of game streaming. I picked Last Epoch as a game since it has had? a reputation for being hard to run at 4k.Even at 4k, I could play it and my views on game streaming have changed a bit. This was last year and I was using an i7 4770k based system. I can say pretty confidently that I found the local lag spikes from not having a high end gaming PC to be far more frustrating than the consistent 40ms of latency via streaming. Maybe it s because I m getting older and don t have the same reflexes anymore, but I couldn t even really notice the latency via streaming.I also think people are seriously overlooking the trend towards secure computing. What if you put a TPM in a video card? Then your video for the game stream can be encrypted and only gets decoded just before being sent to your HDCP compliant monitor. I think it s much harder to build cheats if the client side doesn t have any data to work with beyond video that gets decrypted as it s sent to your monitor.Heck, even just a lack of local game data gets rid of most cheating, right?

2024-10-06 19:14:50.000	I disagree with the premise of the article -- for several reasons. You could argue that an LLM-based assistant is just a bigger footgun, sure. Nothing will replace a teacher who explains the big picture and the context. Nothing will replace learning how to manage, handle and solve problems. But having a tireless, nimble assistant can be a valuable learning tool.Web development is full of arbitrary, frustrating nonsense, layered on and on by an endless parade of contributors who insist on reinventing the wheel while making it anything but round. Working with a substantial web codebase can often feel like wading through a utility tunnel flooded with sewage. LLMs are actually a fantastic hot blade that cuts through most of the self-inflicted complexities. Don t learn webpack, why would you waste time on that. Grunt, gulp, burp? Who cares, it s just another in a long line of abominations careening towards a smouldering trash heap. It s not important to learn how most of that stuff works. Let the AI bot churn through that nonsense.If you don t have a grasp on the basics, using an LLM as your primary coding tool will quickly leave you with a tangle of incomprehensible, incoherent code. Even with solid foundations and experience, it s very easy to go just a little too far into the generative fairytale.But writing code is just a small part of software development. While reading code doesn t seem to get talked about as much, it s the bread and butter of any non-solo project. It s also a very good way to learn -- look at how others have solved a problem. Chances that you re the first person trying to do X are infinitesimally small, especially as a beginner. Here, LLMs can be quite valuable to a beginner. Having a tool that can explain what a piece of terse code does, or why things are a certain way -- I would ve loved to have that when I was learning the trade.
2016-07-17 06:23:08.000	Also, if you do take the finance metaphor, going into debt is not good by itself. It s the investments you make with that debt that are good, and potentially outweigh the burden of debt. And can be cheaper than equity financing. Going back to programming debt-fuelled programming should buy you something, eg speed to market, and is not a good in itself.

2016-05-29 21:16:53.000	I think that the problem of complex laws will only get worse and worse. It is like code bloat when using test driven development.

2020-12-11 14:05:03.000	There are parents so appalled by the prospect of having an autistic child that they knowingly expose their children to infectious diseases potentially fatal ones because they have been led to believe that vaccination causes autism. When a difference is stigmatised to that degree, it has a wretched effect on the mental health of those who bear itMy parents ended up as antivaxxers when 2 of my siblings were diagnosed with autism. My 3 youngest sisters aren t vaccinated, and one of my autistic brothers isn t up to date on his. Which is crazy to realize that damn, my mother would rather risk having my little sisters die from a horrible disease than risk them being anything like their neurodivergent siblings. I m the eldest, and with adhd I was always treated differently, but not to the same degree.

2018-05-08 16:50:22.000	What do you think of the way things like ZCash and Monero solve that problem? They use hashing algorithms that are more or less immune to ASICS. This is especially true in the case of Monero which just tweaked their PoW algo in order to set monero ASICS back. Stopping ASICs promotes the average person mining on their gaming rig or things like that.Also A small handful of men ultimately control the Bitcoin network because they have authority over 50 of the hash power I think that s a bit hyperbolic. A small handful of men control where the hashing power currently is. However, that can change very quickly. If you don t like what a pool is trying to use your hashing power for, leave that pool.

2013-12-25 06:14:04.000	How you got that from the essay, I don t know, if you see that quote in context he is not saying that at all, he is saying that the low level stuff is neccessary to allow the high level stuff to get built You might ask, Why would someone write code in a grotesque language that exposes raw memory addresses? Why not use a modern language with garbage collection and functional programming and free massages after lunch? Here s the answer Pointers are real. They re what the hardware understands. Somebody has to deal with them. You can t just place a LISP book on top of an x86 chip and hope that the hardware learns about lambda calculus by osmosis.Denying the existence of pointers is like living in ancient Greece and denying the existence of Krackens and then being confused about why none of your ships ever make it to Morocco, or Ur-Morocco, or whatever Morocco was called back then. Pointers are like Krackens real, living things that must be dealt with so that polite society can exist.Make no mistake, I don t want to write systems software in a language like C . Similar to the Necronomicon, a C source code file is a wicked, obscure document that s filled with cryptic incantations and forbidden knowledge. When it s 3 A.M., and you ve been debugging for 12 hours, and you encounter a virtual static friend protected volatile templated function pointer, you want to go into hibernation and awake as a werewolf and then find the people who wrote the C standard and bring ruin to the things that they love.The C STL, with its dyslexia-inducing syntax blizzard of colons and angle brackets, guarantees that if you try to declare any reasonable data structure, your first seven attempts will result in compiler errors of Wagnerian fierceness Syntax error unmatched thing in thing from std nonstd __ mapconst basic_string, __default_alloc_ One time I tried to create a list , and my syntax errors caused the dead to walk among the living. Such things are clearly unfortunate. Thus, I fully support high-level languages in which pointers are hidden and types are strong and the declaration of data structures does not require you to solve a syntactical puzzle generated by a malevolent extraterrestrial species.That being said, if you find yourself drinking a martini and writing programs in garbage-collected, object-oriented Esperanto, be aware that the only reason that the Esperanto runtime works is because there are systems people who have exchanged any hope of losing their virginity for the exciting opportunity to think about hex numbers and their relationships with the operating system, the hardware, and ancient blood rituals that Bjarne Stroustrup performed at Stonehenge.

To the best of my knowledge, the only language that fits this description is the lambda calculus itself.There is a paper, Y in Practical Programs that presents some interesting things you can layer on top of the technique. I ll leave it up to others to debate whether doing so is genuinely practical, or more of a game of functional code golf.

The fund wants your company wrapped up within a fixed time frame either way.2 great things about lean 1 it enables some companies to find their market without ever needing VC, and 2 it sets some companies up to confidently shoot for the moon with a validated market. Lean is helpful. It just doesn t change the mechanics of VC investment. I voted you up someone voted your comment down, which is annoying, because it s a good comment.
2014-06-07 15:06:06.000	For me the problem with .NET is not the libraries but the fact that the two principle languages C and VB are so old fashioned. Hardly any of the useful stuff is part of the language, it s all in the libraries which means that.NET code is very verbose because there is no syntax for things like lists and dictionaries. The latest versions are getting better, at least you can create arrays using a compact syntax but dictionaries are still a pain. Both of them are essentially C without unmanaged pointers and the addition of a few slightly better types but still scalar types are special and cannot be treated as objects.Also they aren t even usefully old-fashioned, why can t we have arrays where the first item is number 1, or 21 or some other number, Basic had that from the beginning. Why do I have to use a dictionary when I want to use an ordinal type such as a character or boolean as the index Pascal could use any ordinal type as an array index . Why can t I create subtypes of the integers and reals Pascal had that and it prevented large numbers of errors . Functional languages have implemented guard clauses, these can simplify your code dramatically and remove the need for a lot of traditional if and case statements. Bertrand Meyer integrated contracts into Eiffel almost thirty years ago, and now MS has provided them by means of a clunky add-on that rewrites your binary after it has been compiled.And so on, it s not that .NET is bad, it s that after all that effort Anders Hejlsberg yes, he of justified Turbo Pascal fame should really have been able to produce something so much better, or at least more interesting.Rant over, thanks for reading if you made it this far.
2023-09-23 03:59:06.000	Anyone evaluating them should be very cautious given their history. e.g. sorry to say I don t have much good to say about InfluxDB. I first considered them around 2015. I loaded about a week of logs from our OpenStack systems into it. It seemed to work so I included it in our set of internally supported systems and started going about the task of adding it to our backup schedule.Well, perhaps things are different now but at the time the only way to do a full backup was to save the output from a command like select from . Before adding that to a cron task I tried it from the admin console and quickly caused the server to OOM and die.It was immediately clear to me that this wasn t a company that cared much about reliability since I was able to trivially crash it doing the only thing I could do at the time to backup my system. Obviously nobody at Influx cared about pesky things like backups or workload management, so I quietly decommissioned the system without incident and moved on to other things.Some years later I watched Andy Pavlo interview their founder on one of the regular CMU database sessions. Andy was very critical at many points, effectively telling him we told you this wouldn t work . I felt much the same way.Influx looks very much like a company that may eventually build right thing after building everything else first.

2018-11-10 00:31:47.000	Some numbers in a set called the smooth reals square to 0... without being zero. This seems to create a universe in which every geometric object is infinitesimally straight . I haven t fully grasped why this works. It s like the dual numbers, but somehow made all-pervasive.It s not the existence of the set of smooth reals that square to 0 without being 0 that creates the universe in which every geometric object is infinitesimally straight.Rather, for any ring of smooth reals R, the set D d in R 2 0 allows us to construct a dual ring as follows. First, take the map RxR - R D sending a pair a,b of smooth reals to the linear function D- R given by d - a bd. Then induce a ring structure on RxR that would make the map into a ring homomorphism when R D, the set of R-valued functions on D, is given the pointwise ring structure.Explicitly, a_1,b_1 a_2,b_2 a_1 a_2,b_1 b_2 since a_1 b_1d a_2 b_2d a_1 a_2 b_1 b_2 d, and a_1,b_1 a_2,b_2 a_1a_2 a_1b_2 a_2b_1 since a_1 b_1d a_2 b_2d a_1a_2 a_1b_2 a_2b_1 d d 2b_1b_2 and d 2 0.Thus, we have the structure of a ring on the set of RxR, which is tradtionally denoted by R e where e psilon is a variable x assumed to square to zero, i.e. an indeterminate, so hypothetical, order 2 infinitesimal.Now, Axiom 1 of synthetic differential geometry asserts that the map sending the ring of dual numbers to the ring of R-valued functions on D is a bijection. In other words, it restricts the domain of discourse so that, when it comes to functions on order 2 infinitesimals, we may only ever talk linear functions, and it also expands the discourse in requiring that we have distinct linear functions, one for every pair y-intercept,slope pair.It is the second bit that forces every geometric object to admit infinitsimally straight approximations, because every geometric object is essentially contained in a copy of R n n-tuples of smooth real numbers , and so it is forced to have non-trivial linear functions from D.---One reference for the relationship to the dual numbers is the first few pages of Anders Kock s book Synthetic Differential Geometry, available from his web-site at home.imf.au.dk kock sdg99.pdf. Another, more readable reference, are Mike Shulman s notes available at

This destroys the RSA cryptosystem no doubt is driving adoption of Curve25519 and Signal.I think we need to talk about layering more. There s no shortage of compute cycles today. Each message should go through encapsulated rounds of encryption, preserving the older standards until it can be definitively proven they are broken, which has not been the case with RSA. At least one of those layers should be multivariate or lattice post quantum scheme.

Is that the same as Onyx, the company that actually ships the products worldwide? My suggestion to you guys is So if we want to see Onyx punished, then we need to find someone who owns an Onyx that has asked Onyx to comply with the GPL and provide source, and showing that they refused to do so. At that point, they would immediately be non-compliant and thus susceptible to many injunctions, meaning their products could be stopped at the border. Pretty sure they d pay attention to that.It needs to be a clear formal request with proof of ownership and failure of the supplier to provide source for the GPL to be applicable.

When combined with WSL2, Direct X paravirtualized graphics for Linux, and Azure Sphere based on OpenEmbedded Yocto , it s a major endorsement for Linux and the flexibility of Type-1, CPU-assisted virtualization pioneered by open-source Xen.The Microsoft Linux license for IoT embedded devices includes support for 10 years of security updates, which will hopefully extend OEM firmware support timelines for edge hardware, This talk will cover ... device security from the chip to the Linux kernel, user application isolation, network communication, cloud interaction, and what it takes to keep a system secure for 13 years.

2022-06-15 14:48:36.000	Do you really need 200g protein at 2500 calories? Those numbers seem off to me, 200g protein is what a big guy trying to gain a lot of muscle might eat to make absolutely sure he s getting enough, but 2500 calories is what a big guy would eat to maintain or even lose weight. Everyone is different, but you might need either less protein or more calories than you think you do.If 200 2500 really is the goal then I m not sure you can do it without meat, or at least without lots of protein powder supplements. The highest protein calorie ratio for normal food I can think of is from soy milk or lentils, which are both roughly the same at around 1g protein per 11-13 calories, and you d have to eat those exclusively.

2018-04-03 19:18:41.000	I think we might be seeing a shift in how people consume music that Spotify is better? positioned to take advantage of.First and foremost, I agree that Spotify will struggle if they try to compete with other services on providing all artists.It seems like listeners or perhaps a subset are listening by genre rather than by artist. I know genres and waves of music are nothing new, but with the lower barriers to creation as well as to consumption 1 , we are seeing the number and frequency of new genres and sub-genres increase dramatically.Anecdotally, I find myself using radio based music a lot more. E.g. I have a Synthwave station on SoundCloud that I listen to. I think this style is further exemplified with the popularity of sharing Spotify playlists. This is also why I think Spotify in particular are ahead -- the very people who would listen to Spotify published content are the people that already use Spotify.In fact, I think this style better fits a lot of people who would use a streaming service in the first place. A lot of the people who want to listen to their favorite artists question the idea of paying for a subscription to maintain access to their favorite albums.Of course, if Spotify goes this route, they are not alone. They would have to compete with services like SoundCloud and BandCamp. I think they could find success by toeing the line between major label content and indie content. 1 e.g. a bedroom musician can make their album over the course of a few weeks and then that album gets bought and listened to by someone thousands of miles away within minutes hours of release. No printing copies, shipping, stocking, ticket purchasing, etc.

The other theory that this manuscript is about plants from the american continent 1 is less flawed in my opinion. It could also explain why it s in an totally unfamiliar script, as it could be a pre-Spanish language, or an attempt from a foreign to codify it. 1

The problem is simply that because they are so vertically integrated, they have high fixed costs, and so a relatively small drop in revenue means a huge loss in profit.

I m keen to see examples where bip buffers exhibit particular issues relative to circular ring buffers, however, and if you ve got any then please send them along.The chief use-case for my bip buffer implementation is using a shared memory segment for inter-process communication, and adding mmap for address mirroring on top of that just seems like a can of worms I m not particularly interested in opening.
2021-07-30 20:26:40.000	I fully agree here - MVC scales terribly. Of course, it s not impossible to come up with a well designed MVC app at scale, but it takes a ton of skill and feels like you are fighting the framework at most steps.One particular challenge is lack of modular components and component nesting. For example, if you have a list view, it s very natural to have one component define the list, and child components define each entry in the list. Something like React makes this trivial.On iOS on the other hand, you are encouraged to use a UITableViewController with UIViews for each cell. This immediately pushes you towards one mega-controller which mixes the responsibilities of the list with those of the individual cells. To overcome this, you could try to have a UIViewController for each cell uncommon , or have the UIView of each cell start taking on more responsibilities of a UIViewController breaking MVC .In general though, iOS s MVC is a perfect storm of being both bare bones as well as opinionated at the same time. For these reasons many large corporations have moved away from MVC to their own custom in-house architectures to handle scale. Facebook - Uber - Square -

Typically electrodes are buried in a mixture of bentonite and gypsum, which is pH neutral and provides low resistance. There are also chemical salt earth fills which work well but require thicker copper electrodes to deal with corrosion. Various conductor arrangements are used, but in shallow trenches there is always the problem of the wires being cut. A radial or cartesian mesh burial over a larger area would be typical. You can buy electrical mesh and ground enhancement fill for this purpose. Note that you still need it to be below the frost layer in your region -- which varies from 15cm California to 300cm Canada depending.An earth connected via a distant cable isn t going to be effective against lightning transients are high frequency and hence conductivity is constrained by the skin effect, and long wires have high inductance even if they have low DC impedance , and additionally is poor practice as it is more lightly to be cut without someone knowing in the future. I doubt any EE would approve it when other methods are available. IEEE 80 81

2021-12-10 17:41:27.000	Misinformation looks a lot like being wrong. And we can t solve being wrong . We re going to be wrong a lot before we re right.The problem stems from the fact that we have to allow people to be wrong to get any sort of progress. If we must be 100 correct before pushing forward, we d never push forward. Sometimes, it has to be just good enough .From the start, we thought the Earth was flat and all that ever was. We were wrong.Then we thought the Earth was round and everything revolved around it. We were wrong.The we thought the Earth was round and everything revolved around the Sun. We were still wrong.Fast forward some time.Now we think the Earth is an oblate spheroid orbiting a medium sized star in an arm of a spiral galaxy traveling away from the point of origin. We are likely still wrong about this.But less wrong than yesterday. And that s what s important.It s not critical thinking we need to teach. Such a loaded concept to begin with. We need to teach people how to be wrong. That it is ok to be wrong. That wrong often leads to right. We can t become so entrenched in our ideas that we can never move from them. Don t wait for the other guy to budge on their ideas. And don t concern yourself with them. Unless they re incredibly lucky, they ll spin their wheels while you eventually get to right.

2022-06-01 06:49:05.000	Tried this many times, never got it to work properly.I m not sure if it s because my teams are too small, or I m bad at communicating.When discussing technical specifications the most efficient way in my experience is to throw people into a room with a whiteboard and a few laptops and don t let them come out until they ve ironed out each other s concerns while this is uncomfortable, the alignment is unmatched by anything else I ve tried.In my current role we write detailed technical specifications in google docs but the end result is similar, an ocean of tech specs that may be defunct or relevant or in draft status, dense reading and or infinite questions once the document is produced or worse no questions at all! Which means either people didn t understand it or they think it s fine .
2024-07-25 20:55:00.000	Embedded projects are never about doing things as fast as computers we have full scale computers and routers, and firewalls, and switches for that.Embedded is about solving problems more physical in nature, as you are physically closer to reality in nearly all aspects.--------An MCU FPGA project could implement... say... the VFIR IrDA Infrared protocol at 16Mbit.Traditional IrDA is widely supported at SIR and MIR levels upto 1.152MBit or so . Anything faster and the equipment has basically been lost to the 1990s and never was very popular anyway .IrDA I d explain as a remote-controller on steroids. Its infrared based like TV Remote Controllers , so you need to line up both devices and have them looking at each other. Infrared can reliably travel about 3 meters over the open air in a variety of conditions. IrDA allows for bidirectional communications. Its a truly wireless protocol, albeit one that requires significant alignment to function correctly. But 3 meters is good range and practical for many applications.Nominally, you could use an entire MCU to handle the encoding decoding of these light-pulses. However, that s a bit redundant. Its far more cost efficient to dedicate a few LUTs in an FPGA to the task.Yes, the MCU is needed for the final application-level OSI layer 4 5 6 7 aspects of IrDA protocol. But the lowest PHY and MAC levels of the protocol can and probably should be a small section of FPGA.Upgrading from standard MCU 1MBit to 16MBit would be a 1600 improvement to communications compared to what s readily available with commercial-off-the-shelf solutions. If you ve determined that IR Communications is good for whatever purpose you re using, maybe the 1600 improvement is going to be useful.------------EDIT The physicality of this is because photodiodes react very quickly to light pulses. And an expensive enough transistor can amplify that at the 100MHz speeds needed to run VFIR at least in theory. I ve never done this .The FPGA or MCU if you go that route... just needs to clock at 100MHz or so, and interpret the start-of-frame and end-of-frame signals, while also interpreting a few other low-level details. Overall, this turns the sequence of light pulses into bits-and-bytes for higher-level processing which code can and should handle .

In my case, Sarno s book showed me how my neurotic fixation on RSI was making it worse.I wrote this comment in 2016 My RSI continues to be totally gone it s been gone 14 years now, the RSI started a couple years before that , and I never even think about it anymore.If you have RSI and you are reading this, please try to keep an open mind. Not all cases are the same, and fixating on worrying about the RSI constantly is not necessarily the best path forward.

2010-10-30 17:11:35.000	You underestimate Google s own ability to take advantage of new web standards and technologies, and Google s inhouse skills of running huge data centers efficiently. In the pure search tasks, Google is likely going to be really good in the future too.At one point, the serious future threat for Google was Facebook, because Facebook was a big walled garden, that Google couldn t crawl. If Facebook is the number one web page for a few hundred million people, businesses start to operate inside Facebook more on more, which would make Facebook a good starting point for your searches too, making Google the second choice.Although other aspects of this scenario have happened, the search part hasn t, and it seems that Facebook has changed the strategy from walled garden to more open place, and try to become a critical infrastructure piece of the whole web with like buttons and instant personalization.

2021-03-03 21:19:03.000	I think there s value in having a certain amount of ownership and control of a developer ecosystem. It s open-source, but Google will probably remain associated with Flutter and have the dominant influence on its future.I m not totally sure what you mean by a toolkit for platforms they have a vested interest in . Google has a vested interest in basically all the platforms out there. They might create Android, but they certainly make a lot of apps for iOS. I m guessing they d like to simplify things using Flutter. Mac and Windows might not see a huge number of native Google apps, but that could change over time - especially if they have a way of making a web version and a desktop version out of the same codebase. Imagine a native macOS Gmail client using Flutter. The same code that could compile to JS for the web could compile down to native for macOS.Having something be open source and widely adopted makes a language and ecosystem stronger. The Go authors noted that they open-sourced Go because it would become stronger as more people used it.And I wouldn t underestimate the soft power that comes from being in charge of one of these things. VSCode, .NET Core, and TypeScript are all free, but it s given Microsoft a huge amount of soft power in the ecosystem and a lot of credibility and mind-share.With a cross-platform UI kit, you can definitely end up with a lot of power. Maybe the experience on Android feels better and more native because your engineers are putting their effort into the Android UI and its patterns more. That s not to say that they d purposefully make the iOS experience bad or anything, but maybe the iOS-style widgets don t get quite as much polish and maybe developers get encouraged or defaulted into shipping Android-style Material Design apps to iOS. Again, I m not saying this is malicious, I m just saying that Google might spend more time on the pieces that are important to them. Google s web docs for Flutter could easily include sections for and this is how you hook it up to Google Cloud .I think it s also important to recognize that while Android has more marketshare globally, Apple is generally more popular in the US and generally more popular with upper-income folks. Apps like Clubhouse often launch as iOS-only. 11 months after launch and the Hottest New Thing is still iOS-only. If Google can convince developers to use Flutter for the Next Big Thing , it guarantees that it will be available for Android.I think there s a lot of value for Google. Your teams can build better apps in less time cross-platform. You potentially become a leader in the way that Facebook has with React, Microsoft has with VSCode .NET Core TypeScript, etc. You guarantee first-class support for your devices. You guarantee that the new things you want supported will get supported since you can prioritize your engineers on it - and potentially even get supported in the way you want. And potentially some nice tie-ins to Google Cloud and Firebase via first-class support, documentation, etc.

That afternoon, DCPP caseworkers separately interrogated Kate and her husband, Jesse. Kate agreed to a second urine test, which came up negative. She was finally released that evening, but her baby did not come home until October 1, ten days after her birth and five days after DCPP cleared Kate to bring her baby home. Although the DCPP cleared Kate and Jesse to take baby A.L. home, the hospital kept the baby for another five days, and the agency s investigation continued. It included a Certified Alcohol and Drug Counseling evaluation and yet another urine test, which was negative for all substances. In November, Kate received a letter saying the DCPP had concluded that the allegation of neglect was unfounded.

This was a complete shock because it featured full motion animation and it was running from floppy disks! This feat was achieved by using polygons instead of bitmaps, to save memory space. This gave the idea a few years later to Eric Chahi to use polygons instead of bitmaps for his new me Another World which would become an immediate hit as well... leading to the game Flashback from a different creator reusing the same technique, and the adventure game Cruise for a Corpse as well, making the game company Delphine Software very rich in the process.There are tons of fun stories when one starts talking about Dragon s Lair.

Both the very tall and very short have difficulties getting clothing, and some of the very tall are that way because of medical problems.Most things are a mixed privilege. An ex-neighbor of mine, who was a good looking fitness instructor who rode a motorcycle, would also be harassed when she was on her bike, solely for being herself. Friends of mine who are moderately rich say they have difficulties because a lot of people associate with them in the hopes of getting access to that money. Take a look at to see the number of people ready to jump on 7 million. While there are many ways to use the language of privilege, and it can even be used as a weapon to undermine other viewpoints, it seems that your last paragraph falls strongly in the standard privilege viewpoint. That is, I suspect that most people who talk about privilege will agree that A black child born into a well educated and wealthy family is far more privileged than a white child born to a poor, uneducated and abusive family is something which falls into the privilege framework, even if some may disagree with its validity or object to a real-world usefulness of a partial ordering which combines multiple privileges.I m therefore confused about how that s an example of how privilege commentary is really unhelpful .
2022-11-02 12:08:02.000	Functional programming won t succeed until the tooling problem is fixed. Tsoding said it best developers are great at making tooling, but suck at making programming languages. Mathematicians are great at making programming languages, but suck at making tooling. This is why Rust is such a success story in my opinion it is heavily influenced by FP, but developers are responsible for the tooling.Anecdotally, the tooling is why I gave up on Ocaml given Rust s ML roots, I was seriously interested and Haskell. I seriously couldn t figure out the idiomatic Ocaml workflow developer inner loop after more than a day of struggling. As for Haskell, I gave up maybe 20min in of waiting for deps to come down for a Dhall contribution I wanted to make.Institutionally, it s a hard sell if you need to train the whole team to just compile a project, vs. make or cargo build or npm install npm build .

2014-09-29 16:16:00.000	I work in IT at a major Canadian University. I hear what you are saying, but the solutions provided by universities IT departments are usually sub-par to completely not useful. There have been attempts in the past to partner with other schools and develop solutions jointly but are often cost over run disasters.It is really hard to attract any top development talent, or even try and convince current employees to stay up to date with current trends. Lots of development teams are stuck in old waterfall mentalities on huge java stacks.We have laws that protects students data and doesn t allow us to host student or even employee information on U.S. servers. Provincial laws and mandates handed down from deans because of the Homeland Security Act hinder the use of any sort of SaaS s. It makes it really hard and disheartening to provide and develop good solutions.I can t suggest someone go use certain survey tools, or use mailchimp to handle a small campaign for example. I am not supposed to promote the use of Google Drive or Dropbox for day to day use with other staff because of fear they will start storing data they aren t supposed to on it. We often end up with sub-par self hosted copies of great applications, but no one wants to use them. Google classroom looks really cool but there is no way any schools in this province would be allowed to use it.
2013-12-17 14:59:20.000	That wasn t really necessary.I m glad you get to work in UI-world all day long that CSS idiosyncrasies are something you can memorize inside and out. Personally, I m required to know a lot more about mathematics and databases. My clients can deal with not-very-pretty UI, they can t deal with lost or incorrect data.But if you want to make analogies about tools, one should always use the right tool for the job and not employ hacks. To me, margin auto is a hack. It doesn t express that the object in question is being put in the middle of something else. It hides the intent of the action behind insider jargon. Or, to continue your analogy, it s using the handle of a screw driver to hammer in a nail.

It s exactly the fact that Twitter tends to be topical, ephemeral, trivial, and faddish that make it worth a special effort to save.In our time, historians are obsessed with the relatively few sources we have for casual thought in the ancient world graffiti and so on.

2020-06-28 17:47:55.000	You are right. Some of the sibling replies argue the contrary by using a sleight of hand stating the desire to associate from only one of the two parties.Take for example the relationship between a man and woman.If both want to live with each other, everything is fine.What if the man wants to associate with the woman, but she doesn t? Do we force her to accept the man? Does he have a right to access her?Obviously that s silly. We all know that the relationship is only valid if BOTH parties consent.And yet in regards to neighborhoods the sibling replies act as if only the man s opinion mattered. That Jew wanted to come in but was refused! People were not free to associate! They ignore that refusing someone is also part of the freedom of association.
2016-12-09 09:31:48.000	More or less than if browsers had blocked Flash say 3 years ago?Because I think that s the standard. If they can do it for Flash, then they can do it for anything else, too. They just need to set a deadline with a reasonable amount of time before it s reached so that all developers can adhere to the new specs.I really hate the attitude of well, too many websites apps would be broken so I guess we ll never do it, or we ll just wait for the web to collapse first so that everyone agrees we should do it from platform in this case browser vendors.If it s that bad, then just set a 2 year, 3 year, or even 5 year deadline for the change perhaps with some intermediary progressive blocking, like it s happening for Flash .It pisses me off because it seems the same is happening with ASLR on Linux 1 . We ve had it for 15 years, but nobody is willing to force developers to use it because it would break things . Screw that. Set a deadline and do it already. If their apps can t make such a change in 3 years, then I could care less that their apps will stop working. Critical vulnerabilities that allow dangerous exploits to happen also break a lot of things , and not just themselves either, but the firefighting patches that come after them, too. 1

I feel like that word is always used to describe non western culture, things and customs that are considered less advanced , less modern, that we need to preserve, when in reality I think it s just another culture that we need to respect and except, and that by calling that group of cultures Indigenous there is some racism involved by all participants
2022-06-13 21:15:42.000	because you can shove me in an MRI and see that my brain does stuff even when I m not answering API requests.People need to stop confusing machines doing useful work with consciousness. You re conscious not because you answer questions or because of the content or origin of your answer, you are conscious because there is an I , a self, that experiences that process. Lambda literally is a web server that fetches data from a funny database called a neural net, when it isn t doing that, it s not doing anything. It has as much neurological activity as a rock.Consciousness or sentience is not a measure of intellect or of capacity to answer questions, it s a measure of perception and awareness. If it wasn t, Eliza the handprogrammed if then chatbot from the 60s would be more conscious than a cat, which I doubt is the case.

Of course, you arrive late, if ever, and burned way more gas or battery than you needed. But the GPS got you to drive by a specific set of billboards that they wanted you to see.

2020-12-18 17:16:15.000	I took a Data Structures and Algorithms course at a brick and mortar university. It was being taught by a substitute teacher from the art department who knew some programming. The class was 5 assignments, the first of which I completed with about 60 characters of Python code I remember feeling smug because others struggled with the same assignment. The other assignments weren t much harder. It s not all bad though, I had a great time hanging out our classes were little more with the teacher and other students.My point is Brick and mortar universities can also be ridiculously easy. Your students are either lucky or unlucky, depending on how they look at it. I m currently approaching 40 hours spent on Software 1 at WGU, and I ve worked as a professional programmer for over 10 years. In my experience WGU has been harder that what I had at my little community college which was actually an accredited university .

2021-04-14 05:35:50.000	It s actually not uncommon for police patrols to notify people if they see unsecured property. And that can be hard to do if no one is home and they don t want to alert actual criminals. To enter the property they often need a court order unless there s an immediate threat , but I ve seen efforts by police to drop notes wherever they see unsecured doors or windows that could be targeted for a break-in. Especially if there have been break-ins targeting certain weaknesses e.g. open windows , police will look for those and alert owners.The problem with a hack is that it can be done within hours on properties everywhere, so just dropping a note won t be fast enough for most. Where there is an equivalent in real-world i.e. immediate threat of a break-in , police can and will act to secure that property.So I don t see the chilling effect, it s something that at least in Europe is common part of preventive policing.

Without physical function keys, I can t think of a way to maintain this with the same convenience, being able to do it one-handed with either hand, avoid conflicting with stock shortcuts, and not sprain my hand.Fortunately, I use an external keyboard much of the time, which I selected almost wholly for its proper 4-groupings of function keys, letting me touch-type them.
2018-08-03 13:44:09.000	That s a good point. Security through obscurity doesn t prevent attacks, but may raise the bar of entry and delay a motivated attacker.I imagine if all 3D printers were distributed with warning stickers saying that they can be used to print guns and knives that more people would try it than if it was less publicized.Making it just a bit harder to discover the knowledge to weaponize something could give defensive researchers the time to build effective countermeasures.

2014-04-13 23:31:06.000	Not necessarily true. However the bigger concern is technology. The tech behind the batteries in a current generation Tesla will be probably one or two generations removed. Meaning, your going to get soaked on first generation buys.Now Tesla does have swappable packs but the unknown is, how much will a replacement pack of second or third generation cost and will you be able to install it in the first generation car I will assume you can.The Tesla lower depreciation is factor of limited supply and the author is taking a mighty big bet that demand will remain as high as it is. Given Tesla s stated goals for manufacture and the models coming this is not a good bet.Toss in that California may cap tax incentives to EVs costing 60k or less I would push that to 40K or less. The rich should never have been given help to buy a car in a price range they already purchase in. This car certainly did not need the incentive.

These profits are returned to shareholders via dividends or buybacks, or just through the accretion of value within the enterprise.On the other hand cryptocurrencies are negative sum. The only way the early folks make money is when late folks put money into the system. At the same time, the house miners are constantly extracting massive amounts of actual liquidity. The sum of Bitcoin is negative 21,000,000,000 per year. This welfare is extracted by Chinese mining cartels bribing their local governments for access to coal-powered electricity. Enough to offset all of the solar panels installed in the entire world.The total amount of wasted power per Bitcoin transaction is now 30 days of power for the average household, and generates 100 grams of non-recyclable e-waste.

At least the OpenWRT variant they are choosing looks recent. Good luck!I m at the point where I only get Raspberry PI-based hardware. This way I know that I m able to update or reinstall in a year or two.
2023-09-03 02:36:53.000	Discord is a very featureful chat and voice app that is similar to slack in terms of managed-ness but they have completely different roots.Slack is basically just business email but IMing instead of email, if you know what I mean. It s very business. Business happens there. Synergy and collaboration and so on.Discord, meanwhile, grew out of some combination of gaming tech IRC servers and gaming ventrilo and teamspeak servers. It s a completely different vibe and clientele that just happens to have a very similar feature set to slack.So having a discord for anything that s gaming or programming techy-adjacent makes a lot of sense and there s a big preexisting community there. I launched an OSRS plugin and we set up a discord channel for it. It was a niche thing, very niche, and we never really took it very far it was sort of partly just an excuse to try out using managed k8s for the backend server that the plugin was a client for . We did 0 marketing aside from listing in the OSRS plugin marketplace and putting the discord link in the description.Suddenly me and my pal had like 100 people in our discord and as many users of our site. With 0 marketing and a very simple MVP.And we didn t do any BI or anything but afaict the attach rate of discord joining to using our plugin at least once was very high, well over 50 . People even asked a few questions and said the project was cool.So yeah. While I wouldn t literally run my business on it, as a fan site it s very useful and valuable.

You always get higher expected returns with higher risk. That s the point or people wouldn t even consider it. You also get a higher probability of losing everything. as long as you can spread the risk around multiple fields.Diversification is a strategy for reducing risk. It s irrelevant to this discussion.High risk as a strategy is sound when you have little to lose. Like when you re young and poor. When you re old and wealthy, it is profoundly stupid regardless of what strategy you employ. It is exactly like being in a casino. You have a ton of cash in your pocket, why would you engage in investments where the probability of losing your shirt is high?

2013-10-07 01:19:34.000	On Ubuntu sudo lshw In general, usually one of sudo lspci sudo lsusb Although you will usually want to look up the raw PCI USB IDs rather than rely on the strings provided by your operating system.Note that this only works if your system actually can find the PCI USB IDs for your hardware in its database adding entries to the list is easier than actually writing drivers for devices, so the probability of this working is relatively high but not 100 . If your hardware is completely unrecognized though, this won t work.Of course, this may not tell you the exact chipset -- usually, for that, you ll have to look at the chip itself and read the markings off of it. You probably don t want to pull your laptop apart to find that out, but if it s a popular laptop, you can often find out what other people have found inside by looking on sites like iFixit.

2021-07-20 13:24:01.000	I agree. It looks like bad translations.Here in Argentina we use a lot of loaned words from English for technical terms, sometimes I don t know which is the official translation to Spanish. But in Spain, they like to translate everything, so sometimes reading technical stuff in es-es is difficult. And if you blindly translate from es-es to English, you may get surprising results.I sometimes write an early draft of a paragraph in es-ar, and then autotranslate it to English. The autotranlation handles the easy part, like word for word substitution and reorder noun-adjective to adjective-noun, but it needs a lot of further fixes to get a good translation. Technical words are sometimes messed, so it s important to double check them. Also, errors that are small typos in Spanish sometimes are translated to very things, that also cause weird results. For example cOsa - thing , but cAsa - house .
2021-04-13 19:51:34.000	Thank you for the blog post, it resonates quite well with me.I thought a bit about this, but that becomes a bit complicated without additional metadata on a file descriptor is it really that additional interface, or just a random FD we inherited? .

2019-12-25 04:23:59.000	This is a thought-provoking response and does make me reconsider my position. It doesn t please me, but perhaps we do need to encourage market pressures that force Mozilla to create a better product.However, as I said in my above post, my objection to Brave largely stems from how it is marketed and promoted. I ll re-iterate People try to sell it as the pro-decentralization and good web citizen browser. Brave isn t doing anything compelling enough to earn that status in my eyes.I am not going to argue about how much Mozilla innovates. Rust is pretty cool I agree they could do more. The people pushing me to use Brave seem to want me to do so as an act of charity. I will re-evaluate my choice to charitably direct my web traffic through Firefox, but, to be honest, my first choice otherwise still would not be Brave.

2018-04-15 05:05:19.000	This article doesn t tell the whole story. Yes, PERS is a problem in Oregon. However, some of the anecdotes of counties cutting services are not related to PERS. For example, Josephine County, next door county to mine, has the lowest property tax rates in the state. Property owners in the county have repeatedly rejected tax increases to pay for basic services like the Sheriff s Department, and as a result have experienced some of the cut backs described in the article. This is not a result of PERS contributions.

2012-08-13 20:06:47.000	I think at that level you don t really learn stuff through tutorials anymore. Tutorials conferences stuff are mostly to get you started and looking in the right direction.You learn the advanced stuff by doing it. Want to learn linux kernel internals? Write a kernel module. It doesn t have to be useful. Want to learn webkit internals? Invent a new tag super-blink! and implement it. It s extremely unlikely that W3 will appreciate your contribution to html but you ll learn a lot in the process.Another way to learn this stuff and a pretty standard way to introduce new people to a codebase in the industry is to jump into the bug tracker. Just start fixing low-priority bugs. It might take you three days to find something that a core dev could fix in fifteen minutes, but you ll learn an immense amount in the process.

This is, of course, not what most people do, since typing in passwords is tedious.However, if you mostly need to boot up the laptop when connected to a specific network e.g. on company premises , and it s acceptable to require a manually typed password when the laptop is not present at that location, and if you use a Debian-based OS, there is a solution!

2017-12-22 15:33:54.000	Suppose it were a social media site. Now that attacker has a working account with someone else s email address, and that email address is considered verified by the site.The attacker could then use that account to post threats, harass people, and so on. If he goes far enough that either law enforcement wants to come after him or someone wants to sue him and the site is served with a warrant to reveal information about the poster what they are going to cough up is the verified email address of the account holder.That will be followed to the email provider, and from there to the email address holder. The email holder s claims that he never made the social media account are going to sound unconvincing--he clicked the confirm link to make the account!Remember, a civil suit only requires a preponderance of the evidence, not proof beyond a reasonable doubt. That verified email might be enough to reach that standard.In a criminal case it would not be enough...but if the matter was serious enough it might be enough to justify a warrant to search the email address owner s place and computer. At the very least that would be very annoying, and at the worst it could uncover things that the email holder does not want brought to law enforcement attention.

2024-05-15 14:26:55.000	The reasoning given was that even though he was situated in Ukraine, he was doing crimes in the US by abetting Americans in copyright infringement. This seems somewhat reasonable to me. If a Ukrainian was hacking American computer networks from Ukraine, should he also be immune from US prosecution?But he wasn t actively doing anything to Americans or American networks like hacking. He was hosting a website where people, including Americans, could post links, and use links to download pirated content. The fact that Americans broke their country s laws is a crime they committed, not him.The judge s reasoning would imply that anything that happens online where Americans could access it and is criminal in the US automatically becomes a crime that happened in the US, which is crazy and total bullshit. Why isn t the US extraditing Hungarian porn actors and porn companies for showing online where Americans can see it exhibitionist porn which would be illegal in many places in the US?It s a ridiculous case.But you can bet that if France tries to extradite someone posting antisemitic bullshit on X related to France e.g. about the recent desecration of the Shoah memorial , US courts will refuse extradition.
2022-02-02 09:21:36.000	there s another issue with measuring too much if you only derive value of that you can measure, you will constantly feel bad when doing things that have no apparent measurable value. So then you say to yourself, relaxing on the sofa has value because it makes you perform better to have breaks. But do you really believe this? And in any case, you still can t help measuring value into relaxing because you are brainwashed into thinking everything must be quantified in order to justify something. So even relaxing or playing video games must be seen in such a context in order for you not to feel bad. it s becoming rediculous.

2009-05-21 15:40:50.000	But I don t feel I m superior to people who can taste the difference. In fact, I d say I m inferior - my range of experiences in my life is poorer than theirs - at least when it comes to coffee. I don t feel superior either, I m just glad I have time and money left over for other things. Feeling superior due to a taste for fancy coffee is the kind of elitism I have no interest in.Plus there s some well-known psychology behind this stuff. Expensive wine tastes better, in part, largely because it is more expensive. Honestly, I don t see how you can present the ignorance of better things as an advantage, except in are really base, utilitarian way, where we are all hamsters on the hedonistic treadmill with no higher aspirations beyond immediate pleasurable gratification. If you re ignorant of better things, you re happy with what you have. If you re familiar with better things, you re unhappy with what you have, unless you spend time and energy on better things instead, at which point you re just as happy as you were before except with less money and less free time. That s the same reward profile as drug addictions, frankly.I think it s even more hedonistic to waste time and effort on exceptional food and drink when you could just keep yourself contented with average stuff and devote that time, money, and energy to higher pursuits. Not that I m entirely uninterested in those kinds of experiences, but I m not the one to be accusing of hedonism here.

2022-11-17 00:58:30.000	I had this problem with a phone case that I ordered from the Google Store. It shipped, allegedly, but the tracking never updated. After ten days I asked to cancel my order but was told that this could not be done as I had a tracking number. If I wished to return the item after it was received, I could do so for a full refund.I spent a week going back and forth with them and explaining that nothing had actually shipped and, again, asked for a refund. 90 of the time they sent me something telling me what the tracking number was and that I could return the item once it was received for a full refund. The other 10 of the time they assured me that I was being handed off to another service tier and that this group would surely be able to help me.The higher tier just sent me the same tracking number and seemingly ignored my pleas and my question of what happens if I do not receive the item before the return window had closed.It wasn t even worth that much, but I was being petty and tried to respond within minutes of them emailing me. My thought was that someone over there was desperately trying to keep their work queue empty, and I was going to do my best to prevent that from happening.They finally refunded my order 18 days after it had been placed. The tracking information still says that they re waiting for the package from Google. I m half expecting a phone case to randomly arrive within the next few months.
2018-07-30 16:40:36.000	This seems to me to open a big can of worms, and goes to the heart of the identity problem space. There are any number of ways to spoof identity with paper- and card- identity-based systems, and if I m an organization that has to know the physical person standing in front of me is some person in my database records, I don t know how I could realistically constrain spoofing to a 1 1,000,000 level or better.Short of only authorizing on entire pairs or groups of people vouching for each other at the same time, like missile launch officers or bigger groups, it seems a really tough problem to comprehensively solve if you are only given a plastic card and one person standing in front of you literally or figuratively to base your decision upon.
2018-10-13 20:23:08.000	Jordan Peterson says it s the opposite. I guess it also depends on how one defines rich . If you re the only child of a multi-millionaire family, then you re in a much better financial position than being one of 3-5 children of a family that is only upper-middle class. But one cannot underestimate the power of having a high IQ though in terms of making wealth. You look at at all these successful people in STEM and start-ups, many from middle-class families and 2nd gen. immigrant families, and they tend to all have high IQs. Just a few days ago someone solved the 310 bitcoin challenge and made a cool 2 million. The person who solved it probably has a high IQ. Same for ppl who invested in bitcoin early. Again and again, with the possible exception of some actor and athletes, you find that with wealth, a high IQ is not far behind.

While I m certainly open to arguments to the contrary, my general worldview is simply that life is not the paramount value to be sought, but rather liberty instead.

Tell me, does it appear to be working?I m not saying Israel needs to lay down its arms and start holding hands with Hamas, but at the very least it needs to offer a path forward. An outline of a path towards resolving this. Instead it has closed all avenues, offers no perspective for improvement. And has never really done so even the Oslo accords was almost entirely concessions from the Palestinian side . It offers noting more than a life of misery in what is little more than a ghetto, subject some the most banal and arbitrary rules please, explain to me how banning coriander and chocolates keeps people safe .This is the entire life for many Palestinians. Many have never known anything other than military occupation and a boot in their face flying a Jewish flag, from a Jewish nation, proudly proclaiming that Judaism demands a boot in their face, and when you complain the boots kick harder. If you complain too loud you risk getting summarily executed with no justice. Your entire life is an exercise in cheek turning.And then you complain these people don t care much for Jews? Gosh, I wonder why. they must ve been born that way or something _ ツ _

2014-08-18 21:13:32.000	I don t recall ever being taught anything about adjective order, but I did pick it up naturally. Or not. I m really not sure.Some light googling seems to indicate that in German my native language the adjective order doesn t really matter, but some say it actually does citing pretty much exactly the same rules as in the linked article .To my ears grüner, großer Drachen doesn t sound as correct as großer, grüner Drachen , but maybe that s just my knowledge of English leaking into my German. It doesn t sound entirely incorrect to me, either, not in the same way green great dragon does. Maybe German does have the same rules about adjective order, but they aren t as strong? Maybe a teacher would put a wiggly line under wrongly ordered adjectives, but it wouldn t actually be a serious mistake, just a weird stylistic choice?Also, it s entirely possible I actually was taught about adjective order, but have forgotten all about it. If you learn English for nine years with either four or five lessons per week you do lots of reading and writing, especially during the later years, actual texts from the real world and actual essays. It s very possible I picked it up through that and it was never necessary to explicitly teach me about adjective order.

2020-07-16 00:37:30.000	I m surprised and delighted to see someone recommend The Discrepancy Method by Chazelle. I love this book, but even beyond it requiring a lot of mathematical prerequisites, I m not sure of the use to most software engineers. I think only the chapters on sampling, geometric algorithms, minimum spanning trees, and maybe linear programming would be useful references on algorithm design for most software engineers.I second the recommendation of Probability and Computing by Mitzenmacher and Upfal. In addition to being much more mathematically self-contained, there is more focus on models and techniques that I imagine software engineers might actually use, e.g. hashing, load balancing.In addition, Randomized Algorithms by Motwani and Raghavan is a fantastic book, and should be doable after completing Mitzenmacher and Upfal. It goes into further depth on techinques for designing randomized algorithms.A bit orthogonal but still related to the idea of what should a software engineer read for interesting algorithm ideas , I really like Approximation Algorithms by Shmoys and Williamson. There is some intersection with randomized algorithms there too.

In essence, you have just made random people the experts, but worse, allowed them to run freely without any risk of reputation harm. I can sue a doctor for malpractice, I can t sue user21389 for false results. Why do you so quickly believe these experiences of randoms?This idea modern healthcare exists to make a profit doesn t apply in all cases, and you imply they use these profits to create a false narrative of experts. But yet ignore that exact same thing is happening with the supplement industry not regulated btw , of people claiming their ADHD was cured by taking a couple of supplements - it s better than being drugged by Big Pharma they say. This individualistic mindset only encourages these predatory companies to swoop in and say hey, I know exactly the right cure smoke this, crush these herbs, drink that.Made even worse by the fact people aren t honest about how their meds have helped them get to a stage where they have replaced old routines with better ones, started therapy, etc. Yet they look back, post on social media antidepressants are the worst - quit now! Forgive me if this is harsh, I ve seen way too many people spend way too much money and time on BS when they could have got serious help.Don t get me wrong, finding a diet that works for you, being more active, being more social, these are all great things nobody disagrees on. But this idea I m supposed to trust a random person online, cured of his ADD, because he started eating less bread is one I am going to treat with the same severe skepticism you hold regarding mental health experts.

One inflation-adjusted value index between 1928 and 2012 placed the annual rate of appreciation for real estate prices at just 0.2 . 1 Overall, real estate has historically been a bad investment. That said, it does seem like there have been obvious indicators when an particular area is becoming a more desirable place to live, and when home prices are likely to go up significantly in the future. Although I imagine people have been hard at work modeling and forecasting this, and current prices will better reflect future appreciation if this hasn t already happened . 1

2022-11-19 16:43:20.000	My general advice in this regard Passive income for people under 25 is a pure financial trap. You need to be making active income and saving otherwise. All your money you earn right now should ideally be spent on developing and honing whatever edge you have in the area that interests you. And it obviously isn t the financial markets.I think this is very true, although I d go one step further and say that saving really isn t that important when you re young. I honestly think the smartest things I did in my twenties were to eat takeaway food for almost every meal and pay a bit extra to live really close to work. People told me I was wasting my money, but all the extra study I got done helped me 5x my salary by the time I reached my thirties.

It doesn t make sense to a lot of people. It s very unintuitive. You should probably make the effort to actually learn the math and physics behind it before just dismissing it, though.

2020-11-06 18:14:15.000	IME 22 year career so far there s a balance to be struck. If you wait to ship till you re happy w the code, you probably waited too long. Successful businesses are often built on surprisingly shoddy software, and time to market matters. OTOH, only ever running in naive startup mode -- ship it yesterday, add features nownownow, any means necessary, shortcuts be praised -- is a recipe for disaster. Given your strong feelings on the matter, maybe you could find a way to help surface the costs and help your org to start fixing them. Because some amount of it is inevitable, and things within a given company only get better when someone cares enough to do something about it. If it works, you re a hero and things improve. If not, you can still jump ship, but with a much better narrative not I got tired of the intolerable levels of tech debt , but I did X in an effort to address same , but ultimately couldn t overcome the institutionalized patterns that led to it, so I m looking to work for a company that cares about software quality .

2024-03-03 15:35:25.000	TL DR Nope, but here is a list of what such a course would use for reading material.As referenced in another comment, Simon Peyton Jones has a 1987 book on compiling functional languages, The Implementation of Functional Programming Languages. Follow that up with some of the referenced papers contained therein and you will have a base level to start at. Following the FP academic boom of the 80 s I would look to the following in no particular order papers of Stephanie Weirich, Simon Peyton Jones, Simon Marlow, Odersky, Philip Wadler and other authors you would find being referenced in their papers the webpages for the Koka language, Idris, the Granule project, Haskell, and Ocaml all have references publication sections that will contain a wealth of material.It is kind of a shame there is not a more one-stop-shop for functional language compiling, but the research is so broad it would be hard to condense. You aren t going to go wrong starting from SPJ s book as the basis. Jones has a talk on YouTube about Fitting Haskell into Nine Terms which is based on a paper that discusses the compilation strategy for GHC regarding the push to keep the internal System Fc language small and clean that is a good watch, along with the Jones talk on Compiling without Continuations also on YouTube and gives more internal views of GHC.Sorry the list is a bit scattershot, if you need more specifics I will certainly try to find a more narrow selection.

However, litigation on the basis of unconscionability is unlikely to be successful due to market realities in the legal field.Payday loans offer financially distressed individuals a method of accessing financing, despite their risk profile. This is laudable.However, most studies on the matter produce voluminous reams of data regarding the debt-trap the industry creates. Ultimately, the public ends up shouldering a lot of externalities created by this loop.Can we achieve the beneficial results while attenuating the magnitude of the wealth transfer from the poor and from taxpayers to the creditors in this instance?It seems we can - there are other models used in the development world for delivering micro-loans which work better. But could they outcompete the margins generated by debt traps? Unlikely. Another avenue is to regulate the industry - which we already do. The Truth in Lending Act arose partially as a result of people being lied to about the contents of their credit agreements. We could create a schedule of fees for advanced amounts, allow for applications for non-scheduled fees on the basis of exceptional Opex or Capex requirements to serve a given community, etc with supporting margin calculations. This isn t hard - we already do far more complicated work in setting acceptable profit margins in construction, utilities, telecom, etc.Are these solutions perfect? No. But are they better than the status quo? It would appear so. That s why we ve migrated off the payday loan model for producing beneficial results in areas where the profit motive isn t the driver of service growth.
2013-05-09 00:28:43.000	Without quantifying the risks involved with your trading strategies, it is impossible to say whether you are beating the risk-adjusted returns of an index fund. Additionally, I am pretty sure index funds, even without risk adjustments, have been proven to be better investments in the long term than any actively managed strategy. And this holds regardless of the experience of the investors. There are always going to be a few exceptions to the rule, but most of the people getting rich in wall street are doing so because they are taking a cut of other peoples money management fees , not because they are genius investors.Also, with actively managed strategies, it only takes one or two bad bets to wipe out years of gains, and due to natural biases, individual investors tend to under-report weight losses and over-report weight the gains. As such, we always tend to hear how other investors are making a killing on a certain stock or trade, but we rarely hear from the losers, which distorts our perceptions of risk and returns so far, I have seen a handful of people talk about their Tesla stock holdings on this thread, but I have yet to see a single person talk about haw bad they are getting cleaned out because they shorted the stock .

2021-03-24 21:37:21.000	China hasn t been communist for a long timeThis shows how wrong people can get about China. It s easy to label a country with things like communism or socialism or what not, but it s not the reality. Can people own private property in China? Check. Can people start a company under the rule of law? Check. Do private enterprises compete with state-owned? Check. Do private enterprises win in market? Check. Do companies resolve their conflicts via rules of law? Check. Does government, to a large degree how large is arguable , rely on market to allocate resources? Check. Does government enforce ration? Nope. Does the government plan all the economic activities in a centralized fashion? Not any more. Does the government mandate a specific way of allocating wealth? Not any more. Does the government insist that the state or the people own everything? Nope. Does the government limit the freedom of its citizens to move around? Yes and no. One can choose where to live and work, but those with a Hukou will have much better benefits. Is China a totalitarian state? Most likely. Is it a communist country NOW? You ve gotta be joking.

When Apple introduced the second lens 51mm , they called it telephoto, even though that focal length is pretty much dead-on the traditional definition for a standard lens. No traditional photographer would call a 51mm lens a telephoto lens.So, for people who grew up with phones as their primary cameras, the new 13mm lens really is the first thing that they d call a wide angle lens. end_nitpick

A very large number of searches are locality based, and it is entirely reasonable to localize them based on IP address and - as you note - the device type .It s also reasonable to customize based on recent session based search history refinements, spelling corrections, etc .The difference between this and personalization seems mostly about semantics IMHO.

2012-08-29 21:04:18.000	I wonder how useful a map really would be since craigslist already provides a neighborhood filter on the apartment search.

You re probably not going to find the perfect apartment in the exact spot on the map that you want.

So you know, 85 of women considered having a tinder account to be cheating, whereas 75 of men did or something like that, I can t really remember . This was reported, of course, as men and women differ about what counts as cheating on social media when the data screamed men and women largely agree about what counts as cheating on social media. The split may be relevant - it does tell you something when 60 of one continent feels one way and only 40 of another does, but Europe is this, whereas the US is that is usually a vast oversimplification.It s generally media driven, the differences make for better headlines, but it crops up all over the place.

It s also insulting towards poor people to imply they are all meth users. A proper analogy would be that they disproportionaly value a job they can have right now over a higher paying job they can have in 5 years.

2015-05-02 09:23:41.000	The average age of forests in the United States is younger than it was before European settlement. The greatest diversity is found in the oldest forests, so there may be more forest now, but because it is so young, it is home for fewer animals, plants, insects and other organisms than a fully developed, mature forest ecosystem. It also means that protecting old growth forests is imperative. - you can see that there are more trees in the more recently clear cut sections, and fewer in the older growth. Also, replanted sections tend to be a monoculture of whatever commercially viable species is favored in an area.It s easy to see land ownership from the satellite images service land to the east has been logged, but not quite as extensively as the mixed private and BLM land to the west.

And why would it?Pretty much all boys got their hands on porn when I was a kid, and it seemed to have no bearing on how we grew up. There s porn addiction and all that, but there s a lot that goes into what defines an addiction and alcohol is legal, so... , and some of the boys I knew who watched the most porn grew up to earn six figures or more in prestigious fields.A child who is viewing porn online is almost definitely seeking it out, and if that s true, they will circumvent almost any of these truly laughable attempts to shield children on the internet.At best, you might be able to instantiate laws around porn in advertisements. But good luck preventing kids from watching porn. If anything, age walls will make porn more exciting to watch because it makes it forbidden.The stupidity of adults never fails to astound me.

2012-08-24 03:58:53.000	To take your increase in traditional unemployment numbers and build on it rates it s a hockey stick! Incarcerated people are all unemployed, and most of them, if in the job pool, are likely to be in the minimum wage or similar bracket.The equivalent of a 3.80 minimum wage in 1980 is also nearly 9 today with inflation, so the group of true minimum wage workers is much larger for yet another reason.
2017-01-22 15:36:18.000	Which is contrary to how many of the framers wanted the nation to be run... I cite Jefferson The Constitution... meant that its coordinate branches should be checks on each other. But the opinion which gives to the judges the right to decide what laws are constitutional and what not, not only for themselves in their own sphere of action but for the Legislature and Executive also in their spheres, would make the Judiciary a despotic branch. --Thomas Jefferson 1804 To consider the judges as the ultimate arbiters of all constitutional questions is a very dangerous doctrine indeed, and one which would place us under the despotism of an oligarchy. Our judges are as honest as other men and not more so. They have with others the same passions for party, for power, and the privilege of their corps. Their maxim is boni judicis est ampliare jurisdictionem good justice is broad jurisdiction , and their power the more dangerous as they are in office for life and not responsible, as the other functionaries are, to the elective control. The Constitution has erected no such single tribunal, knowing that to whatever hands confided, with the corruptions of time and party, its members would become despots. It has more wisely made all the departments co-equal and co-sovereign within themselves. --Thomas Jefferson 1820 This member of the Government was at first considered as the most harmless and helpless of all its organs. But it has proved that the power of declaring what the law is, ad libitum, by sapping and mining slyly and without alarm the foundations of the Constitution, can do what open force would not dare to attempt. --Thomas Jefferson 1825 Over the last 200 years to much reverence and power has been placed in the hands of the Supreme Court, and the federal government in general.

If someone theoretically entertains the possibility that this is the case , then that would be like building sand castles on the shore during low tide.Actually you don t have to go back to the 19th century to read about this. Read what mainstream economists openly say about NAIRU, or what Business Week and the Wall Street Journal were openly saying when the unemployment rate went below 4 in early 2000. They were pretty much calling for higher unemployment rates - as much as you can get away with in this society any way.

If it were, you would see the same game show up in every platform, but that s not what we see. Heck, only recently did we really see games show up for Mac. For high performance contexts, you want to be able to express algorithms in a way that takes full advantage of the hardware, and the lack of homogeneity in hardware demands a platform-dependent solution.

2020-05-02 10:17:46.000	No, 32bit hardware was dropped a decade ago. There has not been a Mac sold that isn t capable of running 64bit software for even longer.32bit was dropped in Catalina, the prior release a year earlier started making it clear it was going away.Neither intel nor amd sell 32bit only desktop processors, and possibly not even laptops.Game developers complain about performance all the time, but given simply recompiling you 64bit gives IIRC a 15 perf win it continues to amaze me that devs insist on producing 32 bit only software.

For example, I don t live in the US and I don t eat beef I find it tasteless and I prefer mutton which is also traditional to my local cuisine . As far as I can tell, the animals I eat aren t given multivitamins and I don t even understand why that would be necessary.I think you re generalising from your experience with meat in your country to the rest of the world without really being very well aware of what goes on in the rest of the world how people eat and how they raise their animals.

Basically this thing can imagine that if you re in a more collaborative role, this can be completely different.And yes I hate it more when I m on Busy. In our company the status seems to matter none at all.. Even when I m on Do Not Disturb one grade more than Busy people tend to keep pinging when I don t answer.

GDP measures the total cost of the output, not the output minus the costs in fact for the GDP of the whole system it s output PLUS costs since the costs count as outputs of other people in the economy I think a better comparison would be revenue surely?

2020-05-04 14:17:01.000	Yeah. But coming from a marketing executive like Phil, this kind of not coming out with it doesn t mean never. It means not coming out with it this next upcoming version. I think the rumor will stay alive.

2018-09-27 13:35:22.000	I do have concerns about the CoC being used for political purposesI can sort-of understand this stance if we were talking about FreeBSD for instance which suffered a similar controversy not long ago but we re talking about a GPL-licensed codebase here. The GPL is far more political than this CoC we re talking about. You can disagree with it of course, but the mere fact that it s political shouldn t be a problem on its own.Also I remind the people browsing this thread that a downvote is not a I disagree button, I see plenty of greyed comments like the one I m replying to currently that IMO do not warrant downvoting.

2020-04-10 01:14:38.000	For example, the Tax Reform Act was sold as incentivizing jobs and investment all it incentivized was share buybacksSo what? If I own a successful company, eventually I m going to reach a point of diminishing returns. At that point, it no longer makes sense to reinvest my company s profits back into the same company. Eventually, I m going to use that money to start a new business. Doing that will make more money and create more jobs than trying to scale my old company past the point of diminishing returns.With a public corporation it s simply a case of management making that judgment on behalf of the collective shareholders.

No complicated config file with shims. Same module style I m used to from Node. Hell, I can even concat ascii text files into my packaged codebase with brfs.

2020-04-28 19:53:09.000	True, but note that in many cases the goal is not absolute security but rather making it as inconvenient as possible for someone to circumvent the licensing.In some cases the licensing security is even weak by design, e.g. Windows 95 or the early AutoCAD. This is desirable when the size of the userbase itself is of value which is actually true for a lot of software! .

2016-11-07 01:39:21.000	I discovered geometric algebra about a year ago, and it s been eye-opening. Bought the book Geometric Algebra for Computer Science.The Versor library looks really useful, and the guy s PhD is a must-read the site GA combines many other maths matrix, tensor, vector, and lie algebras . It is holistic. CGA uses a particular mapping a conformal one of 3D Euclidean space to a 4D sphere. Operations on that hypersphere are then projected back down to 3D. That how it works in a nutshell. ... basically, Geometric Algebra offers a particular richness of spatial expression. Imagine needing glasses and not knowing you needed glasses. Then, when you do get glasses, the world changes unexpectedly. GA is like glasses for the inside of your brain. Conformal Geometric Algebra, especially the 5D variety enlisted here, are like x-ray glasses.

So last month s issue is published, hmm, where do you go from here, up or down? That s the time you buy into a short because you know the next news can t possibly be as good.Its not insider trading if you get your short position the week after last month s magazine comes out, yet its almost guaranteed profit.

At 220lb, you could easily raise lower the thing as one person with some sort of mechanism for installation service. I m really curious how much it d cost in comparison to solar.

2010-02-18 03:06:49.000	I believe there s a few reasons. one is that the google file system blocks that bigtable runs on and reads for your query could be on any number of machines. been a while since I read the google architecture papers but I would recommend it to all. it is fascinating how they implemented gfs, bigtable, chubby lock, etc. the work around is essentially to write your own code that does what a database does - something to the effect of getting a list of keys for the records you are interested in and using that to then scan just the area in your data structure you want.

2024-03-28 12:21:42.000	They re trying to get it to do hierarchical planning. People like Yann LeCun have complained that nobody knows how to do that in AI, only when they say AI they mean neural nets and ignore planning -as in Automated Planning and Scheduling, the discipline that has its own conference and journal, and international competition and thousands of people working at it, and dozens of systems, some commercial, some free, and all but I guess that actually works so it s not AI.Less sarcastically, automated planners need domain knowledge to break up a task into sub-tasks, and the neural net folks don t like that because they are taught at ML 101 that everything shall be a end-to-end differentiable and b have no human in the loop. LLMs seem to encode some kind of domain knowledge, the common sense that the article s title mentions, and so there s various teams trying to get robots to follow instructions with LLM-in-the-loop. A year ago I think it was LLMs generating PDDL, now it s natural language labels that obviously need a translation.This won t work though a because it s trained by imitation learning and nobody cares about a robot that can scoop marbles from bowl to bowl but would need re-training to do the same thing with e.g. strawberries and b the LLM itself isn t grounded anywhere and has no way to self-correct its self-correction, once it falls into error. This, too, shall pass.Btw, are those people mad? Marbles? Couldn t they find something less painful? What happens when your robot overturns the bowl and there s marbles all over the floor of your lab?

2015-12-31 11:04:38.000	Please don t misquote me. What I actually said was But let s not pretend that it just works, right out of the box! TM every time. Emphasis added Of course Linux often works. Perhaps even most times. A couple of weeks ago I reinstalled my laptop, switching from Ubuntu to elementaryOS. Took me about two hours not counting most of the backups . On Windows, I would have needed two days. I have done an OS install dozens of times, with various versions of Windows and various Linux distros. And I find that Linux is often easier than Windows, because you can install all the software from one official repository instead of hunting through the download pages of a dozen vendors. BUT, and here comes the big but - that still doesn t meant that it always works smoothly. Not that Windows always works smoothly, but that s not what we re talking about. We re talking about Linux problems right now. To claim that there are never problems is simply not true.About shell commands of course Windows has those. But when do you ever really have to use them? If you are a sysadmin, perhaps, but again, that s not what we re talking about. We are just considering normal users. Everything that needs to be done can be done graphically. The various Linux DEs have made a lot of progress in that area in the past few years, but don t kid yourself. There s still a lot you can t do with a GUI.And on a final not quite serious note You have to compare apples to apples.If I did that, I would never get away from Mac OS X, would I? D

2014-03-17 20:39:09.000	People with ADHD tend to be very fast thinkers -- indeed this is part of the problem because while we re having a conversation with someone, we ve thought through every consequence of what you just said before you finish your sentence. Because of this, we tend to get to outside the box type solutions much more quickly than others because we can effectively execute parallel tasks in our minds and come up with an answer to a complex problem quickly. The issue then comes in translating the issue in a way that can be communicated with others so much so that when someone with severe ADHD seems to be very pensive in thought, they re likely just trying to work through how to verbalize what they ve been thinking since before you finished talking.Another hallmark of ADHD is actually the ability to hyperfocus , which is almost an autistic-like quality. If I m working on something I m intensely interested in, I can work on it all day long and not notice that I forgot to eat both lunch and dinner. This happens whether stimulants are involved or not. It comes off as a lack of attention because, well, you ignore everything else unconsciously. When hyperfocus happens, you can lose tracks of large periods of time we re talking 6 hours go by and it legitimately feels like 15 minutes. I do agree that it s not so much a disorder as it is just a different way of functioning. It s advantageous in some lines of work a lot of software developers tend to be ADHD because of the hyperfocus and disadvantageous in others. There are coping strategies, but it s no different than the types of things non-ADHD people have to learn how to do -- the strategies just end up being a little different and focused more on reminding us to do things.

Sherlock Holmes My dear Watson, while that is sensible, it seems to me that the balance of probability leans towards their production instance also having the development access credentials. ---Just my way of saying, I think this case isn t as shut and closed as most comments including parent imply. I personally find the etc host mapping a likelier hypothesis but even that can t explain how different credentials failed to prevent this.

2014-10-03 09:13:58.000	Here is a question I hoped to be answered, but it wasn t Why doesn t the HTTP 2 protocol use SRV DNS records¹? Using it would solve some real problems 1. The well-known resilience of mail can be largely attributed to its use of MX records to specify the use of backup servers and or load balancing. SRV records are essentially a generalization of MX records for any service, not just mail, so using SRV records would bring this benefit to any protocol which uses them.2. The problem of www or no www would be entirely eliminated no need for non-standard so-called ANAME or ALIAS records . Just imagine if, in an alternate universe, mail servers hadn t used MX records, it would then have been necessary to have an A record on the bare domain name, and later, when the Web was created in this alternate universe, the web server would have to be the same server as the mail server, since both now would use the bare domain name. In our universe, this position is now solely occupied by the HTTP protocol, which causes lots of pain in the DNS when redundant and harder to update A records need to be put on the bare domain name just for HTTP. Not to mention IPv6, which, for HTTP to work, requires an additional AAAA record on the bare domain.3. The everything is on port 80, let s reinvent everything on top of HTTP problem could certainly have been entirely avoided, and could be slowly fixed, by using SRV records. A server concerned about clients needing to traverse old-style restrictive firewalls could provide a low-priority port 80 server as a fallback. ① A DNS RR for specifying the location of services DNS SRV

2012-01-27 16:07:38.000	The formula I found was quartic, from 1 Nref Nx Wx Wref 4 Nref number of trips of reference vehicle Nx number of trips of other vehicle Wref weight of reference vehicle Wx weight of other vehicle The quartic formula really works in our favor for bicycle commuting if a bicycle with rider is 1 20th the weight of a car, the bicycle will produce 0.000625 the wear of the car. So if commuting were the only purpose of the road, you would essentially never need to replace a road again.This does make adding larger delivery vehicles quite bad. If the average delivery vehicle is twice as heavy as the average passenger car which was formerly used, each trip will produce 16 times as much wear. Looking up the curb weights for a Chevy cargo van 5000 lb and a Toyota Corolla 2800 lb , the actual wear factor is 10x. 1

So if you always have to pay attention, even when the system is active, then what exactly is the point of the system in the first place? Wouldn t it be safer to always pay attention?I guess this is an empirical question. Is it just as safe to a not pay attention until suddenly you have to pay attention, vs b pay attention all the time?I suppose the sudden aspect of a is the dangerous part.On the other hand the constant vigilance demand of b is also dangerous we know people are bad at staying vigilant for long periods of time when a stimulus doesn t change much Does anyone know of any peer reviewed published work on this?

2009-05-13 18:30:23.000	I think simplicity for the user is important, but whats even more important is simplicity for the representative. Ultimately all change rests in their hands, and if your solution makes their lives and jobs more complicated, they re liable to ignore it.Imagine getting 1000 passionate emails on a topic that have nothing to do with your job, or demanding we do something about clean air when you ve already supported every clean air bill that s gone through your office. By increasing the noise they have to deal with, you make it even harder for real issues to get through to them. Focus on designing this solution around how it would be beneficial to the reps, and how they could better understand whats important to their constituents so they can get reelected.Heres some quick ideas on how to possibly accomplish this 1 Let people click a button if a story or issue is important to them and allowing them to add comments. As a rep, seeing 1000 emails is overwhelming, but having a control panel that can easily show you how many people care about different issues is helpful. It could sort the different stories issues by activity, and you could read comments if it looked like a lot of people cared about it so you could get a better idea of what the sentiment was.2 Somehow show what the stance of your rep is on that issue. Theres no reason to blast them with comments if they re already supporting the issue.In summation If you make something that the reps want to use, then people will gravitate towards it so they can get their voice heard, but if you make something that they don t like, then it doesn t matter how great your users think it is. If it doesn t lead to change, they ll eventually stop using it.

2022-11-01 22:09:41.000	This is exactly the mindset that holds science back. While we often romanticize the idea of the eccentric genius who has some brilliant eureka moment and revolutionizes a field, such instances are an incredibly small minority of scientific progress. Every once and again there is indeed a paradigm shift that opens up a new area of knowledge to explore, but then there are decades of methodical effort actually exploring that space. A small improvement in one area can be used to make a more precise measurement in another, which in turn gives further insight to some third thing. And ultimately, while we might not give out nobel prizes for something as mundane as a mild refinement to semiconductor manufacturing or drug synthesis, the value to society of any such development might be many billions of dollars.High risk, high reward moonshots might sound like an appealing alternative to the current strategy of methodical investigation, after all it s just a numbers game and a you only need a few wins to justify many attempts. But unfortunately it does more harm than good. A single experiment without the context to interpret the data it yields or the commitment to refine its operation is not going to lead to new understanding. Unless you were incredibly lucky and just happened to set everything up right to strike gold on the first try, odds are you will see nothing and convince people that therefore there is nothing of interest to be gained by continued pursuit. In analogy to actually prospecting, you re much more likely to hit paydirt by taking the time to study an area s geology and identifying good spots to dig than digging holes in the ground at random.Finally, the very premise that scientific stagnation is a problem we need to deal with is shaky. While it is very difficult to quantify scientific progress, various proxies like numbers of papers published, numbers of subdisciplines spun off, number of patents filed, etc all seem to indicate that progress not only is ongoing but has been steadily accelerating. While the change in our understanding of the world from any one discovery might be less and less, there are so many more possible avenues for discovery than at any other time in history, and each discovery expands our frontiers to expose new opportunities. There is no shortage of scientific inquiry and ideas, the only limit is that we have advanced so far that it is becoming hard to find natural phenomena at measurable scales that our models of the world do not already fully explain. We found all the particles of the standard model, we can construct things on atomic scales, genetic engineering has become mundane and protein folding is solved, we have mapped the earth from space with millimeter precision and are in the process of doing the same to other worlds, we can accurately simulate airflows at hypersonic speeds and the cores of collapsing stars. Most of these achievements would have been gibberish a mere century ago, and the achievements yet to come will be just as unimaginable to us if not more so.
2011-11-30 22:03:14.000	I remember hearing the reason behind that in one of the BUILD conference talks this year. Apparently and sadly there are tons of high-profile Windows apps that would completely break and stop working all-together if the only thing they did in the next version of Windows was bump the major version number up one and changed nothing else. Developers hard-coded many portions of their product to depend on specific version numbers existing instead of looking for available APIs .They learned their lesson after Vista, which is why 7 only bumped the minor version number up, and 8 will follow in its footsteps.

To what extent is the information created by publicly available research made public, mind you, to stimulate further public research belong to the public, and under what conditions could it be used in for-profit initiatives?Maybe I have a wrong conception of what research is supposed to achieve, but commercializing new insights is absolutely one of the intended outcomes. One would sure hope that taxpayer money isn t funneled into research to... just enable more research. At some point the public should tangibly benefit from it, which is not achieved by writing more papers.This all notwithstanding the fact that DeepMind intends to make AlphaFold open source and available to the community.

2015-10-21 18:25:33.000	I disagree completely. I have two Macbooks 2015 air and 2014 pro for work and home but also use an SP3 at home.Biggest weakness of the SP3 keyboard is the lack of gaps. It s a little flimsy but that s not a huge deal. SP4 looks like it fixes both of those things and finally has a solid trackpad.Either way once you get used to the keyboard, Office applications are still far better on windows than Mac. Even with the new Mac Office. If I were an Excel heavy user, it s Surface without a question.Comparing El Capitan to Windows 10, I wouldn t say OSX better anymore. Windows 10 certainly looks far better, no competition. Similarly spec d, my Macbook air feels a lot slower although I do still prefer browsing on it. For productivity, I much prefer the way MS snaps windows to each side and find it far superior to OSX s new split view. Now that Windows has their own mission control , the feature gap has closed significantly.Touchscreen for browsing is pretty nice too.

Your job as a programmer is merely to sow a few of those APIs together to create a shim layer of functionality with a pretty user interface.When you get to this level of simplicity then the human factor can be quickly replaced. That s where robotics comes in.

Will you build an opening book vs Stockfish? Komodo? LeelaZero?If so, how will you generate these LeelaZero games? You ll have to build a computer or rent one from AWS to play these LeelaZero games. What are the time-controls of matches?Self-play at 40-minutes 15-second increment means that you ll only create a game every hour or so. Spend 30-days building databases at 40-minute 15-second increment games, and you ll only reach 720 games of analysis per month of preparation.Self-play at 1-minutes 0-second increment results in a game win loss every 2-minutes maximum , giving you 21600 generated opening book positions per month of analysis. But these 21600 games are of lower-quality.----------Spend 1-month building an anti-Stockfish database, an anti-LeelaZero database, an anti-Komodo database... and you re now 3-months into preparation and there s still Shredder, Johnny, and all other programs that may arrive at the contest.Its not exactly as easy as you think it is. There s no algorithm that automatically builds the best opening book or counter opening book against your opponents. Its a human choice for what the computer will spend the next-3 months self-analyzing and self-playing.Lets think about how to build anti-LeelaZero seriously. Which of these networks do you download as the LeelaZero representative? don t have the time to build an anti-opening database for all of those networks.
2020-09-03 08:57:09.000	Rust is a fine replacement for C , but not really for C, and the reasons why Rust can t be a replacement for C are very similar to why C can t be a replacement for C. Everybody who chooses C today has slightly different reasons to do so, but one important reason is that C is a very small language with a very small standard library, and most parts of the standard library can be ignored without losing any of the qualities of the C language. IME a small language feature set makes it easier to evaluate and integrate third party code, it s hard to say exactly why that is, but that s my experience anyway. Of course one could say nobody forces you to use the whole feature set of Rust , but the same has been said in the C world for decades. The problem is that everybody selects their own subset of the language when having the choice.

IE patents, copyrights, or things of extremely finite supply like land.It s felt to me like we ve gone fromPre 1800 A world where material inputs were very expensive. Complex manufactured goods ditto. And labor cheap.1800-1980 Where where materials were cheap but complex manufactured goods were still expensive and labor not cheap.Post 2000 Where materials are moderately expensive but complex manufacturing is dirt dirt cheap. AKA this is a micro controller with a million transistors. And this is a power transistor. The latter costs more because it requires more metal, silicon and packaging.
2017-08-10 05:28:15.000	You cannot program a smart contract to know who has the most reliable sports scores or political information.You can t do that as a human, either. All you can really do is look at someone s record to see how their predictions have panned out historically. Given the right data sources, a program could do this no problem, and assign metrics to individual sports commentators as well as subsets of their consensus on any particular topic.Given the nerdy propensity of the fantasy sports guys, there s no reason to assume this kind of data won t be available eventually.As for politics, I ll agree with you there - neither human nor AI is going to be able to produce particularly reliable commentary any time soon! If I bet that Hillary Clinton won the election, and she lost to Trump, what s stopping a hoard of Clinton supporters from voting or tweeting or however the DAO collects their data that Clinton actually won the election and stealing my winnings?This is called a coup when it happens IRL, and happen it does. The chief difference here is that in reality, pitchforks and torches are needed for these efforts online it s a little bit physically safer.

2021-10-18 05:10:49.000	Sorry, you are conflating my arguments. Being cheap doesn t solve the availability problem, I never claimed that. Being cheap means that you can solve the issue with poor storage efficiency with more infrastructure. I.e. compensating for the inefficiency of storage is not an inescapable flaw of renewables.Your other point still stands though, renewables are not as robust as nuclear. But the answer is still infrastructure. It just needs to be more diverse then nuclear. With nuclear you still have a problem of demand above baseline, so you need infrastructure to deal with that. Renewables have the same problem except sometimes the baseline it self drops. The answer is the same you build infrastructure that can handle such drops. And that infrastructure is the same as for the problem of demand over baseline in nuclear, storage and more power production elsewhere with a robust grid.

2015-07-08 23:19:30.000	You write C code that gets compiled down to native code. Xamarin provides C bindings for the platform s APIs. You can, therefore, do anything in C that you would do in the platform s normal language.This is appealing to those who prefer C , and to those that want to share business logic between their iOS, Android, and WP apps, but want to write that logic in a higher-level language than C .Disclaimer I work for Xamarin. Just saw your question was unanswered and thought I d explain the basics.
2024-01-14 18:48:42.000	I don t claim to never make memory safety mistakes in C . I just claim that it s very rare. The overwhelming majority of my bugs are bugs in business logic.At my day job, I work on a project that s 75 C and 25 C . In the code that we ve shipped, when there s a crash in code that I ve written, as opposed to business logic bugs it s usually a memory safety mistake in C . There was an interesting architectural choice written a decade before I joined the company where most classes have a synchronous constructor, then an asynchronous initializer, then an asynchronous uninitializer, then a destructor that gets run by the GC. There s no end to bugs relating to crashes because the initializer hasn t been run yet or the uninitializer has already been run.When I get C bugs put across my desk in code that we ve shipped to customers, it s usually a bug somewhere else. For instance, the last crash dump that we ve gotten from customers in C is because a we called a Windows UTF-8 16 conversion function. The Windows function itself is all raw pointer nonsense, so we put a pretty wrapper around it so you put a std string_view in and get a std wstring out, or you put a std wstring_view in and get a std string out. Well, it turns out Windows is a fucking dogshit operating system. If you initialize a thread wrong , ie, by calling the C11 function thrd_create, and your locale is set to a CJK language, it will ignore you when you tell it the code page of the multibyte string is UTF-8 and will assume it s the system locale s code page, and will call abort when it hits a UTF-8 sequence. instead of perhaps returning an error or null pointer Those are the sorts of C crash bugs that I deal with.My secret to dealing with memory in C is to not deal with it. Make the STL do everything. Make RAII do everything. Can this object be POD with constexpr accessors? Do that. Can these methods be const? Do that. Can these objects live in a STL boost container? Do that. Do they need to live in a unique_ptr shared_ptr instead? Fine I guess but it would really be better off as a value instead. Does this class need to have a special destructor copy constructor move constructor? Find some other way to do it. If you must, try to find some other way to do it anyway. If you must, spend like 10x as much time scrutinizing it, the way a Rust programmer would do with unsafe. If thing must have special destructor copy move constructors, factor out all of the things that need special consideration into a class with the barest minimum. If it must have a special destructor, explicitly delete the copy move constructors operators if you can. Avoid indexing into arrays use range based for loops, or stuffs like transform, reduce, or transform_reduce. The solution isn t to use vector at which does bounds checks instead of vector operator which doesn t the solution is to not use indexes at all.

2020-06-23 20:44:46.000	Very accurate!Regarding the theme of joins, I would just add that QuestDB also has a concept called SYMBOL which allows to store repetitive strings into a table as an integer in the background, while letting the user manipulate strings. This means that instead of storing something like sensor_id and then looking up the corresponding sensor_name using a join, you can manipulate sensor_name directly and skip using joins.

I m not sure whether I d want to cram my current phone in there with its memory chips intact.I guess there are a lot of factors to consider, whether people can afford a certain device or whether they care about disposing of certain types of items responsibly being some of them. Some of this probably varies based on the region of the world as well.

If rent-regulated tenants are getting a market-busting deal on their cheap apartments then by definition, they aren t going to do better on the free market. If they aren t getting a great deal, then they aren t really affecting the market.As for these theories about raising people s rents to help them move somewhere else...we re really getting deep into the doublethink here. posting on another account because rate limits

Or how about GitHub? If they were obligated to provide phone support to anyone with an account, their only option would be to disable all free accounts. If you wanted to use GitHub, you d have to get a paid account. The whole idea is ridiculousThey way you ve framed it, perhaps. Or maybe not.For one If you wanted to use GitHub, you d have to get a paid account is not that ridiculous. It s how businesses worked since the dawn of time people paid to get their services. If GitHub and every other selling eyeballs business is forced to come back to that, that s a win in my book.Second, notice the strawman phrasing If they were obligated to provide phone support to anyone with an account . How about them being forced to giving it to anyone with a PAID account?

I wonder if there s a corollary to some internet rule that the more generally useful a tool is, the more detractors will push for other tools to be used? It would help explain why programming language discussions get so contentious.Pandoc is seriously a great tool! I love the way it s designed and have found it useful off and on over the years. Truly marvelous for making information available in any needed format.
2020-05-16 12:55:12.000	or are you asserting that large team game dev is unique compared to other industries?Well, that would be a good question to ask to the author, since he titled the article modern C gamedev and not simply modern C although to me what is discussed seems to be general enough, and gamedev here happens to be just the type of project the code comes from... To me, it does not look like he makes any significant contribution on how modern C could serve specifically games development . IMHO he has detected that people in games react strongly to content about C and he benefits from the additional exposure he gets by putting gamedev in his C articles tweets anything which is something I am not judging btw .Personally, I do think that when your code is simulating a whole parallel universe using a not-super-high-level language, you might end up with challenges regarding readability and flexibility of the raw code that other softwares might not encounter. Not being really part of that industry I feel I can t know for sure, and therefore I have applied the same reasoning to him since he is also not part of that industry, it seems.
2021-09-16 20:44:05.000	I worked at Acorn in the early 80 s. I once arm wrestled Chris Curry in a bar. Neither one of them was really a Steve Jobs figure.

There is sometimes an issue of conflating IT to CS, but the converse seems to happen much more in my again, anecdotal experience. In that case a mediocre engineer with some software experience is crammed into an IT role because the engineering team doesn t really want them. If a SE adds a lot of value to an engineering team they are usually very reluctant to give them up.
2023-06-07 17:42:47.000	I m intrigued enough by this article that I m going to dig deeper into the economics behind it. This article seems to highlight the cultural and political impact of the policy more than anything. As someone mostly naive to this way of thinking, let me highlight some thoughts on the subject. Price control only works so far. It s possible to price control an industry into ruin. There is a real risk when using these policies. How does employing this tool differ compared to other levers we have. Raising corporate taxes. Enhancing price gouging policies. Nationalizing critical industries. Who controls the price control lever, what is there mission, and how are they held politically accountable. This seems like the type of thing that needs more separation from the election cycle like the Fed or Supreme Court than the average law or executive order. Do we trust the controller of the price control lever? What does success look like? What does failure look like? Are we concerned that reducing private profits will reduce private investment? As bad as the chip shortage was, look at all the investments into fabrication that followed.

2023-01-26 19:04:21.000	I honestly don t believe that social networks bring us closer together. They can, but in practice they don t. Instead I believe they give us the illusion of feeling closer and more involved, but that is likely cognitive dissonance akin to thinking ChatGPT is smart because it speaks . The only way to build relationships is through shared experiences. This can be done online btw, but these experiences are not doing things like liking peoples posts or occasionally commenting in threads. They involved personal and or group conversations activities. That s why you re more likely to find friends playing videogames online than through a social network assuming pure online .
2024-05-21 16:14:25.000	Digressions aside, what value is there in allowing an uninformed person to make impactful decisions on complex matters?Yes, all of the time.

I am not a doctor, I pay them to tell me what s wrong and what treatments to take. Seeking out expertise is a paragon of making wise choices.
2020-07-09 04:15:50.000	What nonsense! Copying something is reproducing it. If it cannot be copied then it cannot be reproduced. If it can be copied then it can be investigated.I ran into exactly this problem with White s Reality Check WRC , described in White s 2000 Econometrica paper titled A Reality Check for Data Snooping , The algorithms that were being tested were so poorly described that less than half could be reproduced.Once we got there for what we could we found two fundamental problems with Whites Reality Check , one theoretical that is blindingly obvious once you see it and the other that they ignored trading costs. When we measured the levels of trading costs that would permit the algorithms to work it was clear they could not.That we could not deduce without reproducing the results. If we could have copied the original code it would have shaved about eight weeks from my research.BTW Whites Reality Check was at the time pone of the most cited paper in its, rather narrow, field.
2014-11-13 18:35:01.000	My wife was a psychology major at Marymount University like 15 years ago and I joined her for a talk by a researcher who was promoting the idea that vitamin deficiencies affected mental illness. It has been a long time so I don t remember the details. I just recall specifically that throughout the whole talk everything sounded straight forward, evidence was intriguing, etc and then at the end someone asked how many other psychologists look at vitamin deficiencies, who else is doing research, etc and he said he was the only one he was aware of that did so. Was very surprised. I wonder how much that has changed over the years.

2015-07-21 02:15:48.000	While not wanting to paint with too broad a brush, many nursing assisted living facilities have as a first priority the avoidance or at least dilution of liability. For example, in one facility, the management, the building owner, and the nursing provider will likely be three separate business entities.

2016-04-19 15:30:30.000	For now we want to learn as much as we can about how people get value from a tool like this and then try to align the revenue model with the value. While we d like to make some money now, our costs are very low so we can continue to give away the planning for free.Google s model might work for us they give away a lot of resources for free and help a lot of people, and they charge certain segments of their audience that can afford to pay. So while people are accustomed to paying advisors for a plan, we think it s better for our audience and a competitive advantage to be free.There s other ways that people are accustomed to paying advisors now that could work. For example commissions on insurance sales. The price of insurance is fixed by regulations in the U.S., so you pay the same price regardless of where you buy it might as well buy from us and get a free financial plan too - Another company tried charging for plans, but that didn t seem to work, they ve since changed their model. We think it ll be better for our customers and for us if the financial services companies pay for this somehow.

2021-10-08 04:29:36.000	I m not sure I d agree with some of these people here that Austin is worse than SF. I ve driven in both within the past 6 months.But geographically speaking, Austin is pretty awful. I35 is basically the in out for all of the commuters from the north and south. There are some tollroads but Austin has had trouble getting people to use them because they were so expensive. They even raised the speed limit to 85 as an incentive and still enough folks wouldn t pay the astronomical rates! Now, for people making software engineer salaries, they could afford it, but they likely won t be enough to continue investment in the needed timeframe.Apple, Tesla, etc, so many huge names are moving to Austin and the city just wasn t built for it. They have enough room to make stuff happen, but construction takes money and political will. Austin is a blue city, but we all know money leans red, especially when it comes to increased taxes to pay for city projects. Can you imagine the amount of money that would need to be spent to imminent domain a subdivision for a new freeway? I can see the speculative investment purchases already! Hold them up in lawsuits for a few years while the housing prices get pumped to kingdom come.Now, I live up the road in quaint little ole Dallas, so what do I know? I ve watched the price of housing increase by 30 in a couple years. It s absolutely insane. Lucky for DFW, it has had more of a focus on transportation development across the entire metroplex a lot longer than Austin, so even during rush hour you can get all the way into downtown from the far suburbs in an hour. Granted, this is also made possible by an insane amount of investment in toll roads, but they ve been strategically built through the wealthiest neighborhoods, forcing residents to take them just to leave home. Obviously not required, but the city knew they had money to burn. DFW also has the second ? largest airport in the US, processing an insane amount of cargo and thus we have highways to match. DFW boasts 4 professional sports teams, a major backbone of financial services, a thriving entertainment scene, and still plenty of room to expand.DFW still lacks around public transportation, but if you are willing to pony up the cash for a place in the city, it s certainly possible to commute in a reasonable amount of time. You will absolutely need a car still for weekend activities unless you want to ride a bus for 3 hours one way.Californian s, if you re going to move to Texas, go fill up Austin first before I buy a house next year, but then when you realize it s too crowded down there, you can come visit the state fair going on now !

2024-05-23 14:47:52.000	The thing is, wrap-around is not only well-defined, it s common, and EXPECTED.No, it s really not. Do this experiment for the next ten thousand lines of code you right, every time you do an integer arithmetic operation, ask yourself if the code would be correct if it wrapped around. I would be shocked if the answer was yes in as much as 1 of the time. The most recent arithmetic expression I wrote was summing up statistics counters. Wraparound is most definitely not correct in that scenario! Actually, I suspect saturation behavior would be more often correct than wraparound behavior. This is a case where I think Linus is 100 wrong. Integer overflow is frequently a problem, and demanding the compiler only check for it in cases where it s wrong amounts to demanding the compiler read the programmer s mind which goes about as well as you d expect . Taint tracking is also not a viable solution, as anyone who has implemented taint tracking for overflow checks is well aware.

The stress-coping hypothesis suggests that many toxoplasmosis-associated changes, e.g., higher extroversion in infected women and lower in men, or lower suspiciousness of infected women and higher in suspiciousness of infected men all in comparison to non-infected peers can be interpreted as gender-dependent stress coping reaction.- Using among infected men women in place of of would add a lot of clarity here.I believe I ll stop reading the article.

Heck it was changed and they even switch from SPDY to http2.Or a big one is MpegLA was commiting basically extortion and Google created VP8 and gave away for free. But then did a crazy thing of even giving people that use for free protection from patent infringement. Who does that?That is why we do not pay what we had to for mpeg2 licenses. Just not aware of similar from MS?Or a big one is Google finding Shellshock, Spectre, Cloudbleed, Heartbleed, Meltdown and others. MS has so much to lose and does not find anywhere near what Google does to help the entire industry. Plus Google even shares mitigations.Instead Google finds MS vulnerabilities and gives them 90 days and MS b thches about it instead of thanking.But then all the papers of things that are now just defacto standards. Like GFS, Map reduce, Bigtable, Borg with K8s and just so many more.Some are ways we now do things.Then all the source code they give away.

2020-12-27 19:10:34.000	Comparing drones and cars is also very disingenuous given that cars and driving are heavily regulated and relatively well understood by people since they are an integral part of day to day life almost all over the world, while drones are still mostly seen as harmless toys and the vast majority of people operate and treat them as such.How many people take a car for a spin on a working airport runway because all that asphalt means it s a good place to have fun with the toy, especially without a driver s license or any idea of the rules of driving? Because plenty of people do it with drones. A better comparison would have been with laser pointers, another thing many people think is just a harmless toy. Of course for the latter cars we even have demonstrable harm, not only aggressive overregulationThis goes way beyond disingenuous. Do we have to wait for the harm to happen before considering regulation? There s a lot of truth in the popular wisdom that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure so I m curious what s a solid argument to suddenly demand being reactive rather than proactive especially when it comes to lives. I mean other than the one making my point above, that people want to play with the toy .

2012-09-21 20:57:53.000	In my last job I wrote several automated backup systems for MySQL servers, and they continue to run as part of a SaaS hosting service. Holy cow, I m an expert! Thanks for reminding me! Of course, one never feels like an expert, because part of being an expert is that one knows the names of some real experts, who are better than you. In this case, some real experts in MySQL backup work at Percona. Hire them. Alternatively, buy the O Reilly book High Performance MySQL, which is partly the work of Percona s founders and has chapters about backups. If you are the foremost expert in a field, of course, you probably don t feel like an expert either, because you re at the frontier, where everything is confused and all the other experts are most lost than you. I don t understand this field! The references are irrelevant and confused and make no sense! I don t know how to make progress and I can t find anyone else who does! I must be really stupid!
2024-05-12 03:34:07.000	The short answer is No, there isn t a simple treatment for Autism based on simple diet, lifestyle, or supplement changes. There are countless books, blogs, and social media influencers claiming to have unlocked something, but it never translates to something broadly useful.There s a long history of these claimed fixes. They follow popular trends that come and go. They ve been attached to everything from eliminating dyes and food colorings to every possible alternate diet out there.Placebo effect is a large part of it. People feel better when they feel like they have some control over their condition. They buy into the popular narrative and then they really do feel better, even if nothing has actually changed physically.It s also common for people with major medical diagnoses like Autism to start thinking that every one of their symptoms is attributable to Autism. Some of these people might have gluten intolerance as a separate issue, so going gluten free improves a number of issues for them. Instead of attributing the improvement to improving their gut problem, they assume they have treated their Autism.

2014-12-13 14:03:09.000	This article is surprisingly better and longer than I expected, but it skipped over explaining one important distinction ELF is an executable file format, but a.out is more than just a default file name it s also the name of a totally different executable file format.Originally, the a.out executable format, and hence, the a.out file name were due to being the assembler output of Ken Thompson s assembler in 1968. Most all UNIX-based systems have moved to using newer ELF format, but there are a few hold-outs still using the older a.out format. As for why ELF formatted executable files are still given the file name a.out by default, even when they are not in the a.out executable format, it s just a historic artifact or annoyance due to compilers and linkers.

2021-07-01 14:34:29.000	I also have a similar memory as a teenager swimming in a river. A young boy was on his own, with only his face above the water, with said wide-eyed expression. I asked him if he needed help, he managed to say yes, and I pushed him to the river bank. He ran back to his family.I heard his mum giving out to his older brothers for not watching him. There is a good chance that young boy would have run out of energy and slipped under the surface with no one noticing. It s a nice thought that I may have saved his life and also saved his family from all the grief and guilt that would have caused. I doubt he remembers it - not that it matters.

2022-06-16 00:38:32.000	We are using AWS Aurora non serverless and getting crushed by IOPS charges. We do very little caching in our app, which makes the architecture simple, but the downside is we end up relying on DB-level caching implicitly. And so when the DB instance has enough memory, IOPS are modest. But once we outgrown it, we have to scale compute up just to get more RAM or else we get destroyed on IOPS.Seems like from a cost standpoint Neon does a good job of avoiding EBS entirely and thus this particular problem would be sidestepped. Is that right?

I think this is kind of the point they make in Steve Jobs bio as well. Xerox allowed Apple to use some of the concepts in the lab because they were investors in the company. Also, if I recall correctly, Apple engineers went a little farther in the window metaphor, allowing, for example, to overlap and stack windows, something XEROX wasn t able or willing to do.

2012-05-30 13:04:07.000	It s very easy for a wealthy VC to sit on a stage and pontificate like this.Not everyone has opportunities in front of them to work on a project they believe in and make enough money to pay the bills with it.Most of us have to struggle through years of working at jobs that hopefully use our skills well, putting in time on nights and weekends pursuing something we do believe in and feel passionately about.Our passion projects go through half-starts, frustrations, and down blind alleys sometimes having to battle against our own pessimism, peer pressure, time demands, and the sense that everyone else is doing it better, and more easily. The truth is it s not coming more easily to everyone else, but it s human nature to see things that way. If we re lucky, we get it right, and maybe that personal project gets a foothold fuck traction, it s hard enough to get a toehold at the beginning . For a few, there s a chance to even quit that job that s making you prematurely old and finally do just what you want. For many people, that doesn t happen for years and years, if it happens at all, and there ought to be a medal for anyone who can simply stay motivated and persistent for that long, whatever comes of it.And in all of this, I m still talking about a small subset of the American public, and an even smaller subset of the world. We re talking about some of the luckiest people on the planet those of us who can even consider things like life plans because the circumstances of our lives have landed us so far up Maslow s pyramid. If you re working at a job that you don t care about, where your manager is a capricious idiot, the office is ugly and the coffee sucks, but you re at least using your skills, you re already in a position that 95 of the world would love to trade places with right now.Don t let a billionaire with perfect 20 20 hindsight tell you you re doing it wrong. If you have to spend part of your life with your excitement and enthusiasm deferred because that s what it takes, don t pile on your own troubles by telling yourself that you re deferring life. Life is one long journey of ups and downs, discovery, pain, joy, frustration, accomplishment, and every other damn thing. Take it as it comes, meet it with your head up, and when you have to slog through the bullshit, slog through it. Just because your passion might flag for a bit doesn t mean it s not going to rise again, and just because you have to sell a product you don t believe in doesn t mean you re doing it wrong.

2024-10-11 13:48:57.000	The way I look at it is Software companies which lean-into rather than fight against an engineer-centric corporate architecture will be better-setup to be more productive and ship higher quality product than any other architecture. They won t always be, every company is different, but its the best starting place because at the end of the day your engineers are your bottleneck. The engineers implement asks from Product Managers, Owners, Designers, Leadership, Marketing, Sales, Customers, Vendors, other Engineers Themselves, all of these sources of work flow downhill to engineering and need to be triaged and prioritized.So, at least for the roles engineers work most closely with PM PO Designer etc , it is productive and good that these roles are framed in the perspective that they re a service asset role for engineering that when engineering needs designs, they go to a designer, that when engineers need an answer to some product behavior question, they go to the PM, who would reasonably be if not the source of truth at least the authority of that domain, etc. That s only subtly different, but definitely meaningfully, than what the GP poster was saying about running the sprint board and controlling what work gets taken on PMs POs shouldn t have that authority, that authority lies with the EM and their discussions with the priorities of leadership.And, by the way calling back to my previous comment, I ve worked in roles where the EMs were less-technical more-product, call these companies product led companies , and each team had almost a bi-archy of an Engineering Manager Engineering Lead representing two sides of this coin. This works really well. If you want a product-biased company, hire product-minded managers, but give engineers a 10-20 year title track that doesn t involve management. If you want an engineering-biased company, promote or hire engineers this can work for more hard-tech infrastructural companies. If you struggle to find great talent, hire dedicated PMs but have them report to your product or engineering-minded EMs. That s it.

Unfortunately, many of my non-US customers still request remitting in their native currency via paper check. And IB doesn t seem to accept paper checks from commercial entities other than banks.Part of my forex broker s value add is they have banking points of presence in many nations, and can accept the check there, then convert to any currency I designate typically USD . That would probably explain much of the spread between IB s and my FX broker s margins.

I use it to see who s starring repos I m involved in, who s following me, and what the developers I follow are starring the feed also has stuff about what people are pushing to repos I watch, but that is not interesting to me because I usually keep track of it by following PRs or issues . Just keeping track of what s going on in the world.Also, now that I have your attention, please please read and make life better for those experienced engineers who do per-commit reviews.Finally, I found the feedback handling from the betas somewhat discouraging.

2018-04-29 09:18:01.000	Although my view is irrelevant, I have never liked a single thing Nintendo has done, I hate all there games, Mario is terrible compared to sonic, all there consoles recently suffer from being underpowered and seem pointless to me. Why are people getting excited about things like Skyrim on the switch, a game that s been out for a long time and already has been played by people that wanted it and when big triple A titles like Fifa come to the platform it s horribly cut down. To me they are disappointing users, not surprising them.However... I understand my opinion is different to that of others and I do find that this kinda single minded approach of the secret creative process seems to yelid great results. I think Apple often does something similar and it s often why outsiders misunderstand them.It s a focusing principle, a frame, something that directs all that creativity and innovation through a lens that produces great results, I think otherwise everything is just to many ideas and too many thoughts.I love this idea.. The thinking that guides us is what can we do to pleasantly surprise players? It s not that we re consciously trying to innovate we re trying to find ways to make people happy. The result is that we come up with things other people have not done.

Their only constraint is finding a justification for the level of surveillance against any specific individual. And when considering how quick social networks fan out, I would think that s game over for anyone posting here.Honestly given how programmers can be indifferent to legal concerns, I wouldn t be surprised if the actual implementation was optimized to just a list of specific targets to not retain surveillance on. And it s probably comprised of a single herd of cows in Wisconsin.It s prudent to just assume we re all on a list .

Eviction protections are incredibly harmful to homeless as it makes it can make it risky costly to rent to homeless, taking housing even further out of reach. Homeless become even less competitive renters.Your comfort and convenience to have the option not to pay a landlord does not rank higher than the desire of homeless to have better access to housing. Places with homeless problems badly need to remove these protections from renters.

Families have known this for generations and take steps to optimize for it just as they do with SAT prep. The resulting reality is that every collegiate sport is ultimately a rich kid sport . Just as SAT prep, orchestra and debate are rich kid activities .The author suggests that no one falls into the river and comes out a water polo star. The same is true for every varsity sport and every varisty player regardless of ethnicity. No one stumbles onto the hard top and pick themselves up as a D1 basketball player either.It takes talent, hard work and yes money time for training, club travel teams and equipment. Facts that the family of every varsity athlete knows all too well.With the hours my daughter puts into practice and travel yes she plays a rich white sport apparently it is a minor miracle she can maintain her k-12 grades at all, yet she does. If she ends up playing for her college it will mean hundreds of hours of practice and play on their behalf while being forced to maintain her GPA. If she were to be injured while representing her college she would likely not be covered by the college healthcare in any way and would likely loose her scholarship. Interestingly enough the same source The Atlantic has an article on exactly this what colleges are potentially asking and expecting from their athletes, do I think it would be inappropriate to favor them against non-athletes during admissions? No, I don t.

2013-05-23 15:44:18.000	I feel the comparison to American Educational system is rather unfair, the American Higher Education being much more evolved and the best there is. IMHO Indian Education system would compare favorably to many other countries with the same socio-economic factors. This is not to say the system does not need to improve, but so does the Education system everywhere else more of the sort of MOOCs Khan Academy for instance college fees have been increasing sharply in India .In my personal opinion historically the Colleges in India were more occupied by handing out more degrees and not education. To go beyond the routine was always due to self initiatives of the select few and not the majority. If the colleges increased the standards higher than the usual then a majority of students would fail out of syllabus was a regular complaint if the exams were too hard . This is not a critique of the Educational system, rather I feel glad that my Indian college education was easy enough to let me pursue avenues which benefited me more than what was taught in classroom. A degree from a reputed Indian college is only to open doors, what you learn depends entirely on how motivated you are.

With a very small syntax enhancer that is JSX you can write XML inside of the Javascript.The end result is that you don t need to learn a template language or many new concepts such as all the ng-repeat, or code inside of strings that angular has.If the framework doesn t support something, you can just implement it yourself. The React dom nodes are just regular javascript objects and you use regular arrays to manipulate them.It is also very convenient to be able to write XML in Javascript. You work with html trees all the time yet you can t easily make new ones in js.2 Having a representation of the DOM in javascript is a huge enabler.Out of the box we can batch all the expensive DOM operations and only update the parts that actually changed.But it allows to do more crazy things. We can put all our application logic in a web worker or render the page server side. There are a lot of cool possibilities once you are in a React world.3 One of the huge issue we face as js developer is traversing the dom to get a reference to whatever node we want. jQuery shine with that. React transforms the paradigm. Instead of finding dom nodes you are creating them.It leads to different ways of seeing the world. If you want to hide an element, instead of finding it and hiding it, you just don t create it in the first place.

However! One thing that s particularly interesting about the security update process for NixOS, is that it s an open collaborative effort eyeballs are definitely needed for handling security issues, especially since LWN stopped doing their reports, but the process itself is definitely one that has significant potential.

Even if that prediction doesn t pan out, we can almost guarantee that typical charging speeds will increase and charging networks will expand further, blowing past critical mass.

2019-09-05 05:05:20.000	Hi, I wrote that post. I don t think that this is quite the same issue.The 2019 post is vague but I think what happened is an attacker stole the credentials for e.g CircleCI s account for Google Analytics. So an attacker could see URL s that were visited, IP addresses, but they couldn t run JavaScript on CircleCI s domain.The difference is between an attacker compromising the Google Analytics JavaScript snippet CDN and an attacker compromising a Google Analytics user account. The latter only lets you read the metadata not make any of the juicy AJAX calls. Also, it s probably not actually Google Analytics, just listing a tool most people are familiar with .It s obviously not good but it s not the same vulnerability I wrote about nor as bad as the one I described two years ago.

There s no statistics in deep learning models. There are some statistical measurements made of final models, much in the same way a good computer science paper covering implementations of discrete data structures might make statistical statements showing the performance of the author s implementation, but like transformers and traditional neural nets and backprop have nothing to do with statistics.

2020-11-08 07:30:04.000	So, this could be done in 1 of 2 ways 1. There would be detailed ballot initiatives that contain full legal proposals, details of their execution, budget, etc. and voters simply vote yes or no to them.We see this as referendums and ballot initiatives. When used sparingly for big questions, this works well, but when used routinely, it puts a pretty huge burden on voters to be continuously informed.Take the California ballot this year. There was a ballot initiative about regulating kidney dialysis procedures. If it were the only ballot initiative, I might have had time to research it, discover the motivations around it is it because of safety, or protectionism for an industry? the consequences does it need tighter regulation? do those regulation costs fall on the consumer? etc.But, there were like 20 of these things on the ballot. At some point, it becomes actual work to figure out all of them and research them thoroughly enough to know what the consequence of your vote would actually be.Ideally, you d have some sort of agent working on your behalf, sifting through the consequences and political motivations, and navigating the yes no votes in a way that aligns with your ideal outcomes. This is, theoretically, what politicians already do 2. Instead of exact legislation, you specify a general intent. Say that you were generally pro-environmentalism. All things being equal, you d like things to go more towards environmental preservation, ending climate change etc.Ok, cool, but now there s TONS of room for interpretation. Extreme case, as executor of this mandate, do I have carte blanche to do anything as long as it decreases the carbon footprint? Anything? Induce a famine to reduce usage and consumption of goods?You d probably need a more thorough statement of general intent and sentiment. Political parties outside the weird US system basically have this. They release a document, usually called a Party Program, which outlines their philosophies and intents.Theoretically, you re voting for the party and the person you elect is someone who is ideologically dedicated to realizing the intents of the shared Party Program to the best of their ability.This system works really well when there s a diverse collection of parties with different ideologies, different levels of concrete plans to realize these ideologies, and paths available for such parties to gain legitimate power and sway in the government.The US parties are missing quite a bit of the above, but I personally think having many parties and fixing our voting systems so such parties can eventually be in congress the presidency would create a system where issues that people actually care about would be implemented roughly in ways they would approve of... at least much moreso than they are now in the US.

2016-03-06 04:01:40.000	I consider myself very lucky that no one tried to kill me when I was suicidal. It s going to get a lot more dangerous now that able-bodied young people are getting social and medical support that kills them for their possibly temporary depression or nihilism.Suffering can always be made meaningful and abolition of pain is not a goal for society but a enervation unto death.Just now in Canada, doctors and nurses are being forced to choose between their professions and holding to a religion that forbids murder. These are their options They can keep their heads down and pray they are never asked to kill a patient. They can surrender and become part of the death machine at the risk of the eternal consequences that their faith beliefs portend. They can give up their careers and hand the keys of what are now religious medical institutions to secular ownership or, move to the United States where, at least for now, doctors and nurses enjoy conscience protections . Finally, the difficult but most righteous course would be to engage in a policy of total non-cooperation with the culture of death, forcing the national and provincial governments and medical colleges either to turn a blind eye or to inflict unjust punishments on doctors for refusing to kill. Perhaps such draconian measures would bring the country to its senses.
2021-07-09 12:56:57.000	Compared to WinUI, I wouldn t exactly call web technologies developer experience pleasant.This was pre WinUI, but a while back I worked at a shop that simultaneously maintained Web-based and WPF versions of an app. The Web version required 3 dedicated developers to maintain. The WPF version needed about half of one person s time, and had more features.I would say that the main thing favoring tools like Electron is entry costs. There are lots and lots of people who know who to do front-end Web development, and you can do a good job of supporting all platforms using free tools. Even if you grant me for the sake of argument that native GUIs cost less in the long run, there aren t a whole lot of people who have experience doing them these days, even fewer who have experience on more than one platform. Going that route also requires you to shell out for Macs and probably also Visual Studio.

For instance, calling a different machine has orders of magnitude more overhead and different error scenarios than making a call to a local process. If you make them look identical, you obscure that.

2010-01-18 16:21:33.000	This feeling is extremely common with very intelligent competent people. I think one reason is that it is difficult to find a valid basis of comparison. If something comes a great deal more easily to you than to most other people, you won t have to work at it the same way they do. Most of society measures a lot of things based on the time and effort you put into it. If you simply have a better idea better understanding of something, that s not a valid measure. You may still work at it -- you may work very long hours in fact -- but if you are getting results that far exceed what others are doing, it can be hard to quantify how and why that is happening.I think very smart people also get a lot of hostility from other people out of jealousy or out of feeling threatened, which I think is part of why some people seem very sensitive to criticism. And then if it is normal for you to accomplish things at a certain level, praise often rings kind of hollow. For some things, it is a little like if your spouse made a big deal every single day about Gee, golly whiz, you drove home from work without getting into a deadly car wreck!! I m so proud of you!! You are just so amazing!! You might think something like Um, yeah, I do that everyday. Shut up and get off my back you whacko. The antidote to this feeling is finding a solid basis for comparison that makes sense to you, that is rooted in facts and not in social BS that can be biased either by being excessively impressed or hostility jealousy. Sometimes people who know you well can give meaningful feedback, both in terms of constructive criticism and in terms of telling you Yea, verily, you did good -- most people can t do that without it feeling like it just rings hollow. But most folks who are only acquaintances will not be a good source of meaningful, useful feedback for this issue.

2013-07-01 05:00:19.000	Yes, the noscript tag can be used. In fact if you see Rails implementation of unobtrusive javascript, the application defaults to its html behaviour in case javascript is off. However, not all frameworks take this approach.Moreover these days, developers don t develop for 100 of use cases. they start with implementation of say 80-85 of use cases. Folks not wanting to use javascript never come into that category, which means that noscript approach is almost never taken except may be in the case that the web application developed is targeted at that user category.Lastly I would suggest this simple solution to block all those pesky ads and pop-ups.

If you re a company, you need security and privacy, and most will just assume that Skype provides it. And for the most part Skype provides them with the security they need. Most of the users of Skype just needs protection from snooping competitors and Skype provides that to a sufficient extend.Honestly no one will care the slightest that Skype has become less secure, because in their eyes it hasn t.But yes, most users for Skype are pretty naive, about security at least.
2013-12-04 17:13:59.000	Don t be silly yourself. What happens if you add or remove a blade, or change their shape or pitch? The swept area stays the same, but the energy captured changes. The swept area is a useful abstraction that gives us the total energy that you can extract from - with your formula - but it s the blades being there with their length that extract that energy.These wind towers on the other hand capture and manipulate the whole air flow from the area of their intake, not just the part directly interacting with the blades of a traditional turbine. That s why it is physically possible to extract much more power than with a traditional turbine with an equivalent swept area .

2020-03-08 02:08:53.000	I m not advocating for the death of privacy but, to me, the writing is on the wall. Technology makes it feasible and the political and economic benefits are too great and too many people are apathetic or complacent. But there is still plenty of privacy left in our personal lives.This is unsupportable IMO as nearly everyone is carrying supercomputers with advanced sensors programmed to surveil them, etc. The battle for privacy was over when the microchip was invented.- - - - Crime never disappears completely, it just pivots to operating within the current enforcement model.That may not be true, I say let s find out, since we re losing our privacy anyway. See Minority Report.No, that s fiction. It s good, have you read it? But it s really more about the meta-physics of free will than anything to do with actual IRL surveillance and policing. The police destroying a house for fun, discussed upthread, is a good real-world example as well.That s also crime. The sensors and computers are a given, the policy isn t note the similarity of that word to police ? That s not a coincidence.

2020-07-01 13:01:22.000	You know what government is really good for?Expensive projects for the public good with no mandate to turn a profit.If you re part of a government agency whose entire purpose is to develop and research new drugs, you re not going to be unduly risk averse. You re going to be doing your job, trying new things, working on getting new, effective, efficient treatments and cures developed, tested, and released to the public.Personally, I don t know to what extent I believe that pharmaceutical companies have actively suppressed research on cures for diseases, in favour of life-long treatments, but the incentives definitely support the theory. Publicly-run pharmaceutical research would also be much more likely to do a proper, thorough investigation of the kinds of treatments that can come out of well-known natural easily-synthesized substances as opposed to the existing pharmaceutical industry, which is incentivized to do research into things that require more specialized expertise equipment, so the people who want the drugs must but them from them .
2020-05-11 21:04:14.000	Doctors being dismissive, especially towards women and people of color, is excessively common.

I m skeptical that hypochondria is as common as people seem to think. I think people with real problems that aren t easily identified and being dismissed is probably far more common that actual psychosomatic illness. Probably somatopsychic illness is the real explanation in many of those cases.
2016-02-08 21:16:31.000	This is an important conversation people should have when discussing security. The dream is perfect security and trust - something that no singular person could ever have completely, because it basically requires a ton of things to happen You need to audit the blueprints for all hardware. You need to verify, physically, the products of manufacturing - the physical hardware you will use - often requiring you to know the design and likewise guarantee the implementation of the fab process. You need to audit and verify all firmware and software running on the system - from your flash controller to your chipset to your CPU to your GPU. This is on top of already having trust in the hardware. You need to then use software that is secure. Perfect security - mathematically proven security - is probably the most expensive thing you could try in software.It is already impossible for any one individual to have audited all the hardware parts and the underlying OS and firmware, but then they need to also personally verify or write themselves the software implementations of security they will use.We all, by using computers, are yielding an immense amount of security in the form of trust. One of the cornerstones of the free software and open hardware movements are how untrustworthy a singular set of eyes upon hardware or software truly are - that having the ability to independently have someone else inspect the code, or most importantly your own ability to do so, is what gives us reasonable expectations of security.So nothing you ever use you can truly claim to be perfectly secure - you are always trusting that someone else is telling the truth when they say it is secure. In the best case scenario, a lot of unaffiliated people claim it is secure ie, free software free hardware . But we are well beyond the point anyone using an Internet based messaging app can presume perfect security, ever. The question is always who you are willing to trust when they claim to offer security - and to recognize when vendors are not promising legitimate security at all, as is the case with cell phones.

It sounds like you are personally upset that your creation was modified by other developers who may have more experience.If you haven t had the experience of maintaining multiple projects with some kind of consistency between them, then adding complexity unit tests? really? may seem unnecessary. I ve had similar discussions arguments with junior developers or non-developers and it s just a waste of time. If you don t have the long view, the whole discussion is moot.Now, if those other developers created an unmaintainable monster, that s orthogonal you can do that with any framework or no framework. You will always end up either A creating a one-off framework anyway or B creating a nightmare of inconsistency.Edit Also, I think it s somewhat amusing that you include jQuery right alongside vanilla JS without irony while denigrating more-modern frameworks.

According to statistics in Sweden, only one third of rapes are performed by someone unknown to the victim 1 .There was a case like this on TV here recently, where a young boy who has been found guilty of rape twice! gets a lot of sympathy from his community while the victims are trash-talked along the lines of she actually wanted it and changed her mind later 2 .1 swedish pdf more swedish added Oh, I also forgot one very interesting question why would a woman falsely accuse someone of rape? In the case of a custody battle I can see the logic, but what would be the gain of accusing an acquaintance who account for a third of reported rapes ?

2009-09-27 18:42:45.000	Don t get me wrong, I m not defending NASA. I m defending the long-term value of space flight, and rejecting the idea that we have to get our affairs perfectly in order down here before we can head up into space. First of all, our affairs will never be perfectly in order, there will always be something else to fix - do you truly expect utopia to be achieved before we can allow ourselves to spend ANY resources on space? Second of all, if we suddenly stop all spending on space, all that money will not magically get redirected to humanitarian purposes ok, a bit of a strawman, you never claim it would . Third, even if ALL the resources were redirected to good use, it would likely be for short-term fixes rather than any systemic gains.I firmly believe that we can and SHOULD do both. NASA isn t the right model - something like the X PRIZE is much more exciting. The same is true of saving the world - pouring billions into humanitarian aid might work for specific short-term goals, but we need different models for long-term change - the obvious being more stable political and economic conditions to allow a self-sustaining standard of living.It s a false dichotomy because, depending on who you ask, you can ALWAYS find a thing Y that is worth doing more than X. Given enough patience and small enough steps, I m sure it s possible to build a chain of things that are increasingly higher priority to achieve, that nonetheless ends up being perfectly circular, like Escher s staircase.

2021-07-10 14:05:03.000	With you on progression. First time you see someone being super fast you call them a cheater. Then you learn about Strafe jumping and that it s just how q3 physics work even if unintentional from the programmers perhaps and you learn it suddenly you re called a cheater by n00bs. Same with jumping onto things of a certain height. If your graphics hardware could not do a certain framerate constantly it was impossible to do those jumps. Get a new graphics card that could render at the full frame rate cap constantly and you could literally just hold the forward key in front of that obstacle and jump and you were there. Someone with worse hardware would obviously call you a cheat because it was impossible. So at least back then it was also a hardware thing. Another one I had a regular PS 2 ball mouse. I was just unable to do certain things. Until someone told me there was a setting in Windows to change the scan rate, which improved accuracy and also a USB infrared mouse. Huuuuge difference. In fact I still use that USB mouse today.I bet this is the same in most games and many many cheaters just aren t.Using a black skin that s part of the game is not cheating if you ask me. Editing a skin to have a bright pink that didn t exist in the game however is cheating.Having played q3 back when myself it was standard though to make _all_ skins be the standard blue skin. The one that came with the game itself originally. That could be considered not cheating and being an anti-cheating technique. I d say it s something that depends on the game though. Q3 wasn t really about shadows and using your surroundings in that sense because it wasn t set up for realism. You also played with gamma pretty high etc.Something like Counterstrike or say Ghost Recon however I would very definitely find it cheating if you changed all skins to be the same because of the realism involved. Choosing the right outfit for a map would be part of the game.
2016-05-31 00:03:58.000	Yes, of course it s possible. Something like FTL is a fun, engaging game which makes use of conflict as a game mechanic and driving force.

2018-02-28 20:16:11.000	Why do we do it? America was literally founded on the idea of independence. That idea got turned into a personal virtue embedded into every citizen that was born and raised or immigrated here to make it .The independent spirit was commercialized capitalized on by advertisers and used as a way to sell us things. Houses with big yards in a quiet neighborhood, two cars, family vacations - all paid for by the sweat off your own back. Your value as a citizen and person was measured by how many things you could provide for your direct family.We should adopt a more family-centered valuation of life and not just the nuclear family, but extended family and found family as well . But we won t. Somehow Americans have this idea that sacrificing something for someone who isn t your chosen partner or offspring is bad, and accepting help by anyone else is a sin.It will be interesting to see how things will turn out in the next 25-50 years. People are becoming increasingly hyper-connected and at the same time mental health issues directly related to loneliness and depression are rising 1 .

Of course this doesn t stop carriers from giving government agencies direct access to communications. If secure communications is your concern then you should always encrypt your calls and data.The Neo900 modem is sandboxed at hardware-level, monitors all activity and gives the user complete control over it so you will know if something fishy is being attempted and you will be able to prevent it. This makes it very difficult, if not impossible for an adversary to take over the device. Regular Linux by that I mean not Android can be installed so it is far less likely to contain any backdoors.If triangulation of your location is a concern, just switch off the modem.

2018-07-10 16:23:23.000	In general, I m pretty happy about this. The more I used Atomic Host, the more I liked it. While it was a pretty dramatic departure from Fedora s dnf rpm world, I really like how rpm-ostree handled the Atomic update rollback stuff. I thought it was a nice middle ground between a traditional Linux distro and Container Linux s just slap a new image down to disk for upgrades . I think there s a time and place for both and Atomic Host had a nice merging. Container Linux with the rpm-ostree tooling should be really nice for orgs that want to customize their distributions.I m only a novice Ignition user though, so I d appreciate it if anyone could tell me what benefit it has over kickstart for provisioning nodes and clusters that makes Red Hat want to keep using it. Kickstart clearly has way more configurability for deciding how you want the host to be provisioned at the expense of added complexity , so the only place I see Ignition adding value is that it s a really easy way to group nodes and assign roles by hostname, like a lightweight Cobbler install or something. Am I missing something else?

2018-05-14 22:09:17.000	Hi, trying to figure out how this site works. Hope you can see this!It s good to see that someone else likes the Spencer case. It really is a fascinating case study.Spencer was trapped in the legal quagmire of Puritan law. He didn t know what to do - he feared the law, and tried to obey his advisers, and generally made a legal mess of things. Looking at it from a great distance it s easy to see what he did wrong, but it s also important to remember that he was the victim of a hysterical hunt and an irrational prosecution.I ve written another high-level and therefore, very general overview of medieval laws and trials here I come to the same conclusion you do. No one is going to defend this blaspheming piece of shit, is a core component of medieval justice.I think you re also convinced that I m claiming these things as uniquely medieval which isn t true. I m trying to provide perspective for someone approaching this topic from a non-academic background of Disney movies and D D games. Hint Every class of intelligentsia throughout time thinks its own set of platitudes, dogmas, and evidence-derived conclusions are immaculate and inviolate. It s like a twisted form of Conway s Law 3 for ideology.Well... yeah? You didn t think I was going on some sort of unironic Randian super-rant here? Conspicuous consumption is a medieval construct absent in the modern period.I was mostly trying to contrast this with the modern idea of net worth and worth so many billion dollars. Wealth as assets, not as an abstract. Uh, people revile people like the Kardashians?Absolutely. Chat with the viewerbase. It s mostly oh my god, did you see what they did now? It s shock and drama and voyeurism. It s not a positive experience, despite being a popular one. Not sure if you re familiar with modern game streamers, but it s the same attitude. History is a long series of contentions, victories, and defeats by conflicting parties with their own self-evident and self-motivated truths--No people, no culture, no time is homogeneous, except to the extent that they are homogeneously heterogeneous.Again, I think you are reading way too far into the intent.Remember, I write a gaming blog. The goal is to try and allow a modern human to quickly adopt a point of view. Most people play medieval people exactly like modern people. Sure, my post deals in high-level generalities - it s designed to grind 1000 years of history and an entire continent and turn it into an easily digestible paste. And it s only 2,000 words long! Of course some detail is going to be lost! Of course important elements are going to be left out! Your response to a few elements is nearly as long as the post itself. My favorite counter-point to the implicit idea that people in the past were unthinking proto-humans unlike us is the entirely mundane ancient bathroom graffiti of Pompeii 5 that wouldn t be out of place in any public restroom anywhere.And yet, for every similarity, differences

2016-09-25 13:22:47.000	This essay is misguided because the author makes the mistake of conflating coding as an activity with coding as a professional job.Both classifications of activity vs job can coexist.Tim Cook was talking about fun and interactive in the context of Swift Playgrounds. Playgrounds is not about writing serious software that calculates the trajectory of a rocket or analyzes DNA samples. Yes, we know that coding can have consequences that kill people.It s as if someone wrote motorcycles are fun and an essayist responds with, Motorcycles are NOT fun. Motorcycling must be looked at as a serious activity because if you re a stuntman performing a jump on a movie set, any amateur misjudgment of timing and speed will get you killed. And if you re a policeman on a motorcycle escorting a Presidential motorcade, you must have situational awareness of sniper threats from anywhere. The author has some legitimate points on how programming sometimes must be approached with rigor and discipline but it has nothing to do with Tim Cook s quote. For a lot of programmers, coding is actually a fun thing to do.If someone says X is fun , you could conceivably write a counterpoint that adds gravitas to X but to do so would be missing the point.

Among other things, the attachment point matters a very a great deal.The attachment point is the of cumulative losses after which a given tranche starts suffering losses of principal. So for example L 20 with a 20 attachment point against historical max losses in the asset class over all credit cycles of 1 is a lot better on a risk adjusted basis than L 200 with a 40 attachment point against historical max loss experience of 15 .Without talking about historical loss experience we can t really guesstimate the margin of safety here nor say that a given tranche is or isn t good value.Another possibly interesting nitpick LIBOR isn t risk-free. It s an interbank rate so it is the short-term yields paid by highly rated financial institutions. Risk free means backed by an entity that can print money, like the Fed. That s why the LIBOR-Fed Funds basis exists.Also, re I think it s interesting how high interest rate risky loans can be considered as sleazy while giving opportunities to the less fortunate is considered an admirable goal. check out the book _Scarcity_ by Mullanaithan and Shafir, which has a super interesting take on this question!

2018-07-24 01:48:51.000	Matthew Walker, a sleep expert, says sleep aids like Ambien are counter-productive. Dangers aside, Ambien and other hypnotics don t necessarily provide you the kind of sleep your body actually needs. In his book, Why We Sleep, Matthew Walker, director of the Center for Human Sleep Science at the University of California, Berkeley, argues that the sleep people get from taking hypnotics doesn t have the same restorative quality as natural sleep. In an interview with New York Magazine, Walker explains that drugs like Ambien simply switch off the top of your cortex, the top of your brain, and put you into a state of unconsciousness. The drugs actually sedate you, he says, and sedation is not sleep. The good news for those who desperately crave sleep is that a variety of techniques and methods can help you achieve a blissful state of slumber without prescription medications. Here s a look at some good ways to reboot your sleep cycle. ... Discussed at length in his book mentioned in this review At last comes an explanation According to the new book Why We Sleep, by Matthew Walker, the director of the Sleep and Neuroimaging Lab at the University of California, Berkeley, the sleep people get on sleeping pills like Ambien is not true sleep. Drugs like these simply switch off the top of your cortex, the top of your brain, he explained to New York Magazine, and put you into a state of unconsciousness. That s not sleep that s cryogenics. According to Walker, sleeping-pill sleep doesn t have the same restorative powers and there are lots, from an immune boost to emotional resilience as good, old-fashioned zzzzs. Sleeping pills don t even seem to work all that well. It s true that some people say they fall asleep faster and sleep better on pills. But, as Walker writes, there s little difference between the amount of time it takes someone to fall asleep with the help of a pill, compared to a placebo. Even a newer drug, suvorexant, only helps people fall asleep four to eight minutes faster, according to one study he describes. In addition to causing daytime grogginess, Walker argues, Ambien impairs memory and increases the risk of cancer and death. Do you feel differently about using or continuing to use sleeping pills having learned about this evidence? he asks the reader. This reporter does. Luckily, there is a better way. Walker recommends something known as CBT-I, or cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia. A major part of it is proper sleep hygiene well-known advice like keeping the bedroom dark and cold, using your frigid cave-bed only for sleep and sex, and turning off anything that emits light a few hours before bed. ... Note that, as Walker explains in this interview with Joe Rogan, if you are not dreaming at night due to alcohol or drugs, your brain may start making you dream when you are awake, leading to hallucinations.

The irony of this is that the accident happening in rush hour is probably minor, yet when I m barrelling down the highway at a steady pace I appear to be a great driver whereas an accident would be very costly fatal perhaps .Also they normalize your infractions sharp breaking, sharp acceleration, speeding, etc by distance driven so long highway driving is even more beneficial few infractions, long distances than traffic jams many infractions, short distances .

The US has both supported the one-China policy and supported Taiwanese independence. Even with these simple statements, someone here will probably find fault and offer a correction.This isn t something that can be understood outside of the ends-justify-the-means , but my pragmatism and other sausage making slogans of the foreign policy establishment. We d have to go through all of the historical machinations before we d even begin to have a context.You re not wrong for looking for some semblance of logical consistency. If you prefer analysis from first principles, that s fine, I d even agree with that perspective in many ways, but you ll have difficulty evaluating the status quo of geopolitics.Maybe a long way of saying that it doesn t make sense, it isn t supposed to make sense under scrutiny, it probably never will make sense and the expectation is for knights-errant.

2013-05-08 11:40:01.000	There are certainly clear differences between parties, otherwise people wouldn t be fighting each other over who gets elected. I like to think of it via a mental picture though - the American political system is like a line on one end, you have the republicans, and on the other you have the democrats. Moderates and independents generally fall somewhere on the line between the two extremes. The issue is that the line they all lie upon is actually just a one-dimensional slice of a higher dimensional space like a plane, to make it simple . My political beliefs lie on that plane, basically equidistant from both of the potential parties. It is therefore basically impossible to get meaningfully closer to what I would like to see by supporting either party, so in that sense there is no difference between them. I actually feel empowered by thinking that way though, because it eliminates distractions politics in favor of actual meaningful actions I can take in my own community building things, helping people, etc. . If politics is removed as a tool, then problems no longer look political and you can do something about them that is ultimately much more effective than voting in my opinion .
2022-01-28 21:44:56.000	Let me try to clarify one of the authors here . The focus of the title is on the news source. It is the news source that tries to avoid conflict in this model. Specifically, at each time step, they see they are getting flagged attacked, receiving backlash, etc and they try to minimize it for the next step.Differently from what the sibling comment says, this is not bred out from a pre-existing polarization. The starting point for users and news sources is to have a normally distributed opinion, where most of the people and news sources are actual neutral. Yet, for a certain combination of parameters, this is not enough and will end up with polarization. And unfortunately that combination of parameters is the one compatible with observed data.The reason why this happens links to a previous study 1 . Even absent polarization, it is the most central news organizations that receive most of the backlash because of some characteristics of the system e.g. homophily people naturally tend to be friend with people with similar opinion as them . This causes central neutral sources to spread more, and thus reach parts of the network that heavily disagrees with them.I will concede that the initial framing of my post is indeed confusing, because it seems that I m talking about users avoiding conflict, while the paper is about news sources avoiding conflicts. I ll try to do better in the future. 1

Sprint is a distant 3rd now. 2 they didn t reach Verizon in time.They had this lovely window of time before Verizon launched the first Droid phone. Verizon users were hungry for a smartphone.

If you can afford more than that, you are golden in my book .If you have that, and you still have savings, what s the difference between you and a billionaire ? All the rich people I know I don t know many are deeply unhappy. So, I know for a fact it doesn t buy happiness directly.I live frugally, well below my means except that I take vacations sometimes , and have a huge safety net also, I never discuss my finances and I don t like to form opinions about someone based solely on or heavily influenced by their money. I cannot see the joy of having things as a status symbol, it just doesn t make sense to me.People that buy things primarily to show to others that they can afford them, just screams self-worth issues to me.

The shipping products manufacturer outgrew the building and is leasing it to the pot business. There s a business near me that manufactures medical plastics. Before them the facility was occupied by a company making pasta. Neither has a sign out front. The only difference is the company name on the white box trucks changed.

2020-10-02 11:24:42.000	Almost all popular apps on Flathub still come with filesystem host or filesystem home permissions, in other words, write access to the user home directoryI agree it s absurd to have a sandbox system that doesn t protect the home directory 1 Browsers and smartphones have an advantage here, because every app uses their file-open and file-save dialogs. If the user wants to open home user pictures whatever.jpg the sandboxed code gets access to that file and that file only, with the user s explicit consent. And if the app s file formats and suchlike don t match that way of working, tough luck because there s no alternative.Whereas on Linux, where there are already 6 other ways of packaging and distributing your app, a new entrant doesn t have the power to dictate terms or force developers to change their programs. And distributing a version of Gimp that couldn t open files in the user s home directory would be absurd. 1

Or, if it s too difficult to switch now, would you have done that if you could go back and do it all over again? You sound like a big organization that could easily justify the allocation. I understand small sites, who can t justify the allocation or just don t want to pay the fees, using ULA NAT to avoid renumbering hassles, but if you re big enough for PI why not use it? It s just as convenient as ULA but is also globally routable so you get to take NAT out of the equation.

For speech to text there are two options and more to come 1 Completely on device command recognition using the ESP SR Multinet 6 model. Willow will currently pull your light and switch entities from Home Assistant and generate the grammar and command definition required by Multinet. We want to develop a Willow Home Assistant component that will provide tighter Willow integration with HA and allow users to do this point and click with dynamic updates for new changed entities, different kinds of entities, etc all in the HA dashboard config.The only issue with Multinet is that it only supports 400 defined commands. You re not going to get something like What s the weather like in CITY? out of it.For that we have 2-? Our own highly optimized inference server using Whisper, LLamA Vicuna, and Speecht5 from transformers more to come soon . We re open sourcing it next week. Willow streams audio after wake in realtime, gets the STT output, and sends it wherever you want. With the Willow Home Assistant component doesn t exist yet it will sit in between our inference server implementation doing STT TTS or any other STT TTS implementation supported by Home Assistant and handle all of this for you - including chaining together other HA components, APIs, etc. 0 -

2021-03-23 13:20:01.000	I would do a bit extra. What that is depends on what your task is and team culture is, and I wouldn t go overboard, but I think that doing 10 more will make you stand out. Try to ascertain the team culture and work with it, not against it. If the team is all about shipping, think of ways to ship quicker. If the team is in a bit of an operational mess, think about documenting processes or writing scripts.What are examples of this? if you are given an operational task that isn t well documented, document it. if you are given a task that isn t documented at all, document it some add a few more tests than you might normally. Or, if there is no testing framework, discuss why not and see if you can add one. read code and create draft design docs A big one that would be helpful to every team I ve ever joined is to take notes about onboarding and either create a doc scripts to help folks get up to speed or improve existing doc scripts.Of course, notice what the team s feedback is and adjust your actions if it is negative. You want to come across as helpful, not as a know it all . I ve definitely been too eager sometimes and come across the wrong way.Also, you could ask your manager or other team members what they wish the team was doing and see if it is something you could help with.

Anyone who deals in this much money has lots of questions asked by governments. That s why your best bet for bitcoins is either to buy them locally from someone you meet up with or to use an exchange like Coinbase where you use bank transfer and it s all above board.

That is, of course, assuming they aren t mispricing it. I ve seen a situation like that where I considered it There are companies that offer small-appliance warranties at approximately an x of price model--reliability doesn t enter into it. If you know that with your use case the product is likely to fail within the warranty... But some searching shows the real business model is to make it nearly impossible to actually make your claim.
2015-08-03 20:20:15.000	I think that for learning basic programming the best language might be Haskell. A lof of people doesn t have in mind that program is mostly simple tranformation of data that can be composed of many functions. I think haskell with it s purity and strong type system teaches it fast. REPL helps. But I also believe in educational power of simple C, although it doesn t have REPL or anything like that, but combined with some simple introduction how computer really works - maybe RAM model gives quite an insight. But learning is fastest when you can see cool things happen fastest and I don t think any of 2 mentioned above is good at this. But yeah - for very basics of programming I would rather pick Haskell over Ruby.

2012-08-05 08:26:57.000	What, no casino analogy?Zynga products are games. Note I m 100 anti-Zynga, but I m also something of an amateur game theorist. Thus, this will be a bit pedantic. Zynga products are essentially casino games which are also compulsion loops but reinvented for social media. Zynga differs from the casino in two essential ways 1 instead of being driven by thrill and desperate hope, the compulsion loop is built on peer pressure and sunk costs 2 instead of being a consummate pseudo-elite luxury experience, it s a habit-forming and largely pointless chore.Poker Disclaimer I have not played Zynga Poker I m inferring doesn t succeed because it s somehow more of a real game Poker succeeds because it s better crafted, largely by years of free play testing in the real world. While in other Zynga products, you re made to feel like you re building up to something, you aren t in Poker. This means that the user gratification being squeezed is effectively infinite the false hope being offered is far more acceptable. Poker is older than the Internet.If you plunge deep into the ivory tower of the games business, sure, you ll find that the term game is very hard to lock down properly. You ll probably even find a useful definition that manages to exclude Zynga products without excluding sensible games. But you ll also inevitably find it is full of problems anyways. In the larger picture, Zynga products are games. They re well-designed for the short-sightedness that they re meant for making money for Zynga in the present but as you say, that short-sightedness is likely to bite them in the end.

2021-07-01 04:29:02.000	I think you missed what the parent poster might be saying, it s not about Bubbles of Comfort . I too live in one of those countries like you put it, and while I live in the bubble to some extent, I know people who ve never used internet or a smartphone computer in their entire lives and live a decently happy stress-free life. Their lives are not nasty or brutish, they re not leading less-fulfilling lives as a result. On the contrary, I think most of them are happier, more content and wiser than me.What you might be doing I think... is making the assumption that technology, things like gadgets or better cars and modern medical health is central to human life. Yes, life would objectively improve if you have those, but if I have to work 60 hours a week doing something I don t really care about, then is that really a good trade-off? I think the answer is not the same as yours for everyone.

But his first compositions weren t great. You write that like it s some super-human feat or something. he was a prodigy from the earliest age. ... Mozarts brain was just tuned for music in a way ours are not. I don t know why people talk like that. Maybe as an excuse for not achieving great things themselves, or even having to try.There was a Hungarian guy who decided to train his 3 daughters to be chess players, to see just how good they could be given a proper training.

2012-01-16 08:07:15.000	I m afraid I didn t see this response until just now, so it s a bit late, but if you re still following this, I d love to see some more specific references - I googled recruiting men in nursing and I see a ton of stuff about how to try to make nursing seem more appealing to guys, but nothing about accusations that the nursing establishment is hostile to men, certainly nothing similar to what is accused against the tech status-quo on a regular basis.In particular, most of the links related to nursing seem to be making arguments analogous to the much derided women aren t interested in tech because the work doesn t appeal to women theory, arguing that men don t like nursing because the work is not perceived by them as male enough in various ways, not that they have any perceptions of anti-male bias in the nursing community. Quite frankly, I d reject any such notions, since there is no such general feeling, at least none that I ve ever heard, so that s not what s keeping people from walking through the nursing school door in the first place otherwise, I figure I would have been at least cognizant of such a general perception .Similarly, I m skeptical whether tech really has any significant misogynist reputation once we look beyond feminist-in-tech bloggers and male me-too hangers-on - none of the women I know seem to have that impression though granted, they re from pretty varied and non tech-centric backgrounds , and I certainly have not seen where I ve worked.When I have asked my female friends about their impressions of the computer world, they tend to think that yeah, it s a circle-jerk of forever-alone dorks, but they generally assume that they d be more welcoming to women and more accepting of them than guys in most fields, not less. When asked why they don t do programming-ish stuff themselves, most have said stuff like that s for the math geeks , and I study people, not code crank the superiority knob to the max on both of those, btw - when I asked this, I got the definite sense that they thought the subject matter was distinctly below them . Not once have I heard because I ve heard that guys in tech treat women like shit as an answer, which makes me very suspicious when people point to that as the definitive root cause...

2022-11-05 17:48:18.000	Getting back to real history, the Nazis were never notably popular. Their best result in anything like a fair election was in 1932 where they took 37 of the vote 1 This seems misleading. The governmental system at the time was a parliamentary system, not a first-past-the-post like most American elections. In a parliamentary system, there are dozens of parties and it s vanishingly rare for any party to ever get a simple majority. Your own link lists 16 parties who had enough votes to get at least one seat in the Reichstag. Selecting the leaders to form an overall government normally involves political maneuvering to bring multiple smaller parties into an alliance to form an actual voting majority. Naturally if there s so much division that it s impossible to form a majority in favor of any particular government, weird stuff is gonna go down.

2023-09-06 09:14:04.000	FLOPS is a measure of throughput. The time-difference between a fmul and a fmadd is often in latency.A modern processor is typically superscalar, with multiple individually pipelined floating point units that can each be issued one instruction per cycle regardless of whether that is a fmadd , a fadd or something else.If you d issue a fmadd to a unit, then you are prevented from issuing a fadd to it in that same cycle, and vice versa. That s one op, not two.However, floating point units are sometimes heterogeneous. I think the question should be, rather should you count the throughput of any ops, or of arbitrary ops. In other words, if a CPU runs at 1 MHz and has two units but where only one can run fmul , should you count the CPU as having one or two MFLOPS?
2012-08-03 19:33:04.000	You sure about 2nd wave ? 2nd wave feminism is usually for things like It should be illegal to pay men and women differently for the same work , etc. Most of that battle has been won to most people. What s currently going on is sometimes called 3rd wave feminism .As for your theory that good feminists stick with hateful zealots in solidatory, that s not borne out by evidence. There is loads of infighting within all groups, including feminists. Some feminist groups are pro-prostitution and pro-pornography, some think pornography and prostitution should be banned. Some feminist groups welcome trans women, some ban them e.g. . This infighting isn t unique to feminism, it happens in lots of communities. Just look at why we have both Open Source and Free Software i.e. a split

2021-07-15 12:20:25.000	My point is that I m not sure even how I would address these issues that you are insisting Linux Desktop evangelist stop excusing .If any one person could do it, it d have been Linus but he doesn t seem interested. It isn t anything a single individual can deal with because it s part of the community culture. Even taking the one concrete example you provided in this thread, Apple s App Store is incredibly popular -- in fact in the US it has a 56 marketshare 1 -- so why would a Linux OS moving toward what you prefer would increase adaption?It s just one aspect of the problem. Apple s App Store has one thing going for it that Linux doesn t there is one App Store. You get your application onto the App Store and everyone can use it. This is not true of Linux Repos. Besides which, the number you quoted is for mobile, not a desktop operating system.Linux Desktop culture has this rhetoric of freedom and control, while simultaneously pushing an application distribution model that wants to manage everything in a very limited way. You can t install applications onto other disks, you can t have two versions of the same application unless the maintainers have deemed it a worthy use case , and you can t keep old versions of applications around unless you want to keep your whole system back too.

2016-04-30 20:40:32.000	Right, so the issues that he seems to have - I see the main issue is that some software links directly against systemd libraries. That is indeed not very good.However, his issues about the difficulties of swapping over packages - well, he has his own distro and he s actually worked out after a bit how to replace it with System V. Linking libraries is not very good, but that s surely more of an issue with developers making bad dependency choices? or perhaps they find it convenient. And he worked out how to get around it with a shim anyway, which obviously increases his workload, but then again he s the one who wants to diverge from what all the other distros are doing!Of course, there is the other point in that it could be argued that the SystemV system doesn t have features that are provided by systemd... which would tend to indicate that perhaps it s lacking in a few areas.He also belabours the point of parallelisation. I cannot understand why he just doesn t change the before or after directives in the unit config files. That s really not much different to the pain of reordering services in the existing System V-based systems!So I m really not convinced - Anyway, that was rather a fun talk, I liked how he was troubleshooting the issue, more power to him that he got his system in the way he likes it.

Messenger bags don t count.Yes, there are kilts, but the vast, vast majority of men would never wear kilts casually.I should rephrase that by without exception , I mean the vast majority of the time . There s a reason that products marketed specifically towards men feature dull drab colors and tend not to have floral scents. I don t blame you for how you feel about the products you prefer to use I happen to buy products from Lush, which have flowery scents that are nose-numbing. Still, I don t think that the vast majority of men would use such products. Then again, if the color of the product was army green and came in bullet casings... maybe.

I play games like GTA or Skyrim and, after being awestruck by their vast, beautiful open worlds, go outside to explore the real world in the same way and get bored much faster. Why is that? Real life has more detail and complexity, so real world exploration should be more interesting, right?You probably have the answer there. Even if the real world holds a larger number of interesting things than a game, the distance between the things is so much larger than in games that I have to spend most of the time just navigating between them. In games, I can get from one interesting thing to the next in minutes or seconds.

2018-12-31 16:26:49.000	It s been a year of grieving for astrophysics pioneers. First, Stephen Hawking this summer, then Riccardo Giacconi 0 just weeks ago, and now Nancy Roman. Giacconi directed the Hubble s earth base Space Telescope Science Institute for 12 years. It s hard to overstate the importance of the Hubble. It empowered physicists to prove that the universe is not only expanding but accelerating in its expansion commemorated in the 2011 Nobel Prize . Its beautiful images also captured the popular imagination of people, inspiring myself and others to pursue scientific careers.To those wondering why she deserves credit, from the NYTimes writeup 1 It was Nancy in the old days before the internet and before Google and email and all that stuff who really helped to sell the Hubble Space Telescope, organize the astronomers, who eventually convinced Congress to fund it, Edward J. Weiler, Dr. Roman s successor as chief scientist for the Hubble, told the Voice of America in 2011. ... In addition to coordinating the efforts of astronomers and engineers in their development of the Hubble, Dr. Roman wrote testimony for NASA representatives making the case for the Hubble before Congress and she pitched the project to the Bureau of the Budget. ... Dr. Roman also took part in development of the Cosmic Background Explorer, a satellite launched in 1989 that confirmed the Big Bang theory of the universe s creation. ... She later joined the United States Naval Research Laboratory, specializing in radio astronomy, and was recruited by NASA in 1959, a year after it was founded. ... The idea of coming in with an absolute clean slate to set up a program that I thought was likely to influence astronomy for 50 years was just a challenge that I couldn t turn down, she recalled in her National Air and Space Museum interview. ... Dr. Roman retired from NASA in 1979 but continued as a consultant as work progressed toward the Hubble s launching. 0

Two cuts are needed to remove it. Along with the quality of steel, and awkwardness of cutting a lock that isn t clamped in a vice, there s no way the thief will be done in 20 seconds.The best seems to be the Hiplok D1000, which took 20 minutes for them to cut using a corded grinder, vice and several cutting blades. Hiplok weighs 2kg, same as my Kryptonite , so looks like a great lock for e-bikes. Only problem is, everyone wants one and not enough supply.

2011-02-16 08:02:29.000	I really hope they do kick the Kindle off of the iPhone. I read about ten or twenty Kindle books a month. I read them on my iPhone when stuck somewhere waiting or whatever, I read and search them on one of my computer monitors while at work, and I read them on my Kindle device in bed.And, if Apple fucks this up on the iPhone--as they apparently are willing to do--then I will finally muster up the effort to get an Android phone and stop using iOS. As a user, I have long been offended by all kinds of things about Apple s behavior since the naziPhone debuted. But I am too lazy and unprincipled to do anything about it.I mean, it s one thing to try to make a system friendly to incompetent and technically handicapped users. Apple does that with the Mac, and the Mac is the best platform out there for almost anything you might want to do. Because you can turn on the right mouse button. You can turn on full keyboard access. You can install Mondomouse and resize windows from any edge. You can fix all the simpleton-friendly crap and it is a kickass system. And you can script all that stuff, so you don t need to do it over and over again when you provision a new Mac. However, it is a whole different thing when you design a system for the low-competence user, and then actively work to prevent any user from fixing the resulting shortcomings. When you even try to make it illegal to fix those an endeavor in which they failed, thankfully .I hate that. And so lately I claim to hate Apple and their fascist little phone, but the good parts are so damn good I cannot bring myself to get rid of it. I was really on the verge of junking my naziPhone 3GS and not getting the 4 when it came out, but then there was that damn Retina Display and I knew I would be carrying another beautiful crippled little mussoliniPhone around with me.But if Kindle stops working on the iPhone, at long last I will be freed! I have so many kindle books, use them on multiple devices every single day, and that would just be the straw that broke the camel s back and with it the beautiful little 320ppi animated chains that bind me.Then my phone would suck in lots of little ways, but I wouldn t have a huge corporation trying to stop me from fixing those things. FREEEEEDOM!!!So here s hoping.

2022-02-07 17:47:41.000	I don t think this was this simple. This might be true of folk artists and it still is , but a lot of artists were sponsored either by the religious institution or by patronage. I personally favor state sponsored artists and I do think that our taxes should go into supporting artists way more then they currently do.However as it stands our current economy does mandate that artists make a living for them self, and while we still live in a world of 40 hour per week minimum wage where most people have little energy and time to work on art hobby in spare time, artists selling their art with artificial scarcity follows logically.All that being said, this is not what we were talking about with the Wu-Tang Clan record. Their piece was a unique piece that works as a commentary on how the rest of musicians distribute their art. I look at this more like a fine art piece or even performance art piece then music. A lot of fine artists incorporate music with their art pieces and nobody expects them to distribute it digitally though many do . This is kind of like the reverse of that.Finally, by allowing our artists this freedom of distribution, we get nice things, including a diverse and healthy art world.

2021-01-14 02:00:43.000	That does sound like a pretty stress-free way to live!That said, living in Europe doesn t always equal good living conditions and stability - it depends on the particular country you re in as well.My net salary is just over 1000 per month as a software dev. My living expenses eat up around half of that. If a quick search turns up that in USA the median salary for a dev is around 100k per year , that means that i d need anywhere from 8 to 14 years to save as much as they could in a year depending on their disposable income, taxes, currency value etc. .In short, i d much prefer not to spend a decade to get to the point where i m as financially stable who s worked for a year, if even that.People oftentimes mention purchasing power parity, but it breaks down in a global economy for example, i cannot afford AWS and most SaaS PaaS tools.That s just one of the reasons why one could look for a better financial situation. Compound interest and investments in general could be another. Stability and peace of mind, although not guaranteed, could be a third.

2020-04-29 02:22:26.000	I don t know what qualifies as decent for you, but instead of an image, I d vastly prefer a plain old blockquote element combined with whatever html one uses these days to specify a monospace font.

2020-03-07 14:12:21.000	I use Slack on a daily basis and view it as just another chat app.Can you edit a message once sent in Facebook messenger?Once you understand why that s important, you ll start to get it.Slack actually cared what the users wanted. Not what managers or IT teams cargo culting current message apps thought workers should have.This is upside down .People secretly installed Slack at workplaces there are old articles on this and the managers had to get it. The rest is history.Last month Signal got a Thumbs up and Thumbs down icons, after how many years.... The IT teams are partly to blame here on top of the managers.
2022-12-13 07:11:40.000	Tag soup might not be perfect, but then neither are widely-used languages that - if they spot a single misplaced period or missing comma or a couple of extra characters after a right-curly-bracket - just QUIT. Why that sort of fragility is tolerated, even lauded is beyond me. That HTML just ignores any tag it can t recognize, without stomping a foot, means all the others are available for other uses. Great!
2023-01-03 14:10:13.000	I mean, that is basically happening already. For almost all jobs it isn t necessary to target a very specific individual but rather a group of similar enough people.Even with alt-right fake news people still talk in real live and that is what really drives it. People coming together and thinking that everyone is of their opinion because of the 25 people in the same pub.Targeting specific individuals could be simplified by AI but in the end, after even a few questions to chatGPT it becomes kind of repetitive in nature.What I see happening soon - A lot of creative work will be aided by AI. This will create a divide and some people industries will fall behind because they do not adapt.
2023-08-21 09:15:42.000	No, modern English would have been better off taking, uh, almost any other European language s spelling system.

If you look just a couple moves ahead into that game, you see that that proposal is just cover for adopt the lowest common denominator of insurance regulation nationwide , because every rational insurance company will simply move to Alaska or Wyoming or wherever regulations are least onerous.The exact same thing happens in banking, which is why Charlotte is a US banking hub.

2022-06-21 20:52:19.000	Fedwire is a terrible foundation to build transaction processing on, since it is extraordinarily slow - it would fail to handle the needs of even a small village.The solution of slapping something like banks on top of it is let s completely forgo all of the Fed s guarantees and build something else while still being hurt by Fedwire s cripplingly slow speed when creating our network .Also, the incentive structures being discussed are only meaningful as long as the Banks believe that the Fed will keep increasing the money supply. If it looks like USD is dying, they have every reason to try to squeeze the last few drops of value from it by running an attack on it and running away with what real money they can extract.
2022-05-17 18:42:22.000	Casting the state as a phantom, rather than a real and challenging obstacle, is ignoring one of the primary motivations for ongoing development of the internet.Of course we don t want structures in this realm that rely on the predatory societal organization of humanity s childhood.The whole point is to move past that.I m not saying blockchain tech does that on its own of course - and I think we all recognize that some of the asinine and childish habits of capitalism are leaking into crypto.Nevertheless, to be internally consistent certainly means that the role of the state even if it has been on relatively good behavior in this limited aspect lately needs to be taken seriously in the context of the system.It s far better to craft solutions that are more difficult for the state to compromise. How is this even in dispute? Or have I misunderstood your argument?
2013-03-03 05:32:17.000	I clicked the link thinking of another article having opinion of how Facebook is becoming more like Microsoft not hot, not cool .

2012-11-29 19:51:52.000	Yeah I agree. But they were trying to hire somebody for a salaried position and in an age where 100k salaries for newgrads are a commodity offering to do that job for 0k really does say a lot about you. I m not saying OP shouldn t work for free, just that he should try to sound less desperate. The job search is like dating. If I tell my partner on the first or second date that I love them and would do everything for them, that sends the worst signals.

2023-04-23 23:00:32.000	I mean - this is the obvious conclusion. Because the metaverse is a stupid idea. Nobody needs the full VR movie theatre when they can go to youtube quicker and easier.If they received push back from dogfooding, that just means they need to knock those sharp corners off. I d suggest what they want is a meeting application and making VR easy to put on and off, and combining the two worlds.It s entirely realistic to dogfood here, people are just reacting to the obvious reactions from the first iteration. You don t stop there though.
2021-11-19 08:54:26.000	The dynamic nature of JavaScript is lost when using TypeScript.Although TypeScript can be added incrementally, in practice I ve only seen it totally replace JavaScript.While I do believe more people prefer TypeScript over JavaScript, I think it s because those people never deep dived JavaScript or bothered to learn it enough to see how powerful it really is. There are also people that just prefer typed languages and will shun languages without static types.This really is a religious war and boils down to one s opinion. I like JavaScript without typing.
2018-05-24 18:07:24.000	Intent is a very important factor when answering the question should the lights be one, I don t think you ll be able to predict that. For instance if movement is detected in the bedroom at 2AM, should the lights come on? The answer is a very strong maybe.You would be collecting data from many sources in order to predict intent. This is why you need a centralized server.
2022-08-26 03:01:39.000	Movie pass failed because different theaters charge different prices depending on what the locals will pay to see a movie. Trying to even the prices out geographically meant that people near cheaper movie theaters didn t buy the passes, and people who went to more expensive ones did. They were fighting against market segmentation, which was obviously a failing strategy and I m surprised they got any investors at all.

2009-10-29 20:39:11.000	Both Scoble s post and this rebuttal really boil down to one thing different people have different information consumption needs. What suits a power blogger might not suit a social-consumption junkie.Me? I used to be a blogger, reading RSS feeds for 2-4 hours a day depending how quickly I found interesting things to write about, and whether it was a catch-up day . I honestly cannot imagine replicating that level of information wired-ness with a simple Twitter list. However! I m now far more casual in my news consumption and Twitter lists are the perfect way for me to get a handful of headlines from a handful of folks I trust.I haven t even set up a Twitter list just yet - only a custom group in TweetDeck. I manually visit four or five sites when I get the time, and get my news that way. I even set up these sites in Google Reader, but it s not all that efficient when you ve only got a handful - I actually prefer to visit the sites themselves, as I can see things like Lifehacker s recommended stories more easily there. HN is the main place I go to for news outwith these sources.
2024-09-16 04:30:09.000	If crypto is the bar, Linux looks even worse. At least crypto was novel in the past 30 years. Linux works on new hardware and... that s it. There s nothing new about Linux. As far as OSes go there is seL4 other interesting research. Linux is a toilet. It flushes. It has utility. That s good, but I don t need to hear about every new release of something which just isn t changing in fundamental ways.

2020-09-07 18:19:03.000	I should ve been more clear- I meant to say that interacting with the police on psychedelics is way more dangerous than just about any scary experience you may encounter while tripping out. If your having a really bad trip then the police can only make it worse, strap you down in a bed or lock you up with really bad people. They may even kill you. It s very possible that a bad trip could be turned around with only a peanut butter and banana sandwich followed by a bike ride with a radio. Honestly, the government and most normal people included are ill-equipped and unqualified to deal with people on psychedelics.

2024-04-07 06:39:16.000	Yup! We observed the same thing back before we built Depot. The act of saving loading cache over a GHA network pretty much negated any performance gain from layer caching. So, we created a solution to persist cache to NVMe disks and orchestrate that across builds so it s immediately available on the next build. All the performance of layer caching without any network transfer.The registry cache idea is a neat idea, but in practice suffers the same problem.

Is there a way off of the buy a new phone if you want firmware updates treadmill? I don t expect you to have a solution, but I m curious to hear how you re thinking about this problem. See-also your phone is new, you ll get firmware updates to resolve this. If your phone is old, you need to buy a new phone or live with a vulnerable device.

2023-06-09 22:33:55.000	For the curious I m understanding, it seems the only real concessions being made are maintaining free API access for low traffic users, mod tools, bots, and non commercial accessibility tools.If they actually make good on their word, that s not too bad of an arrangement. Though I still don t think many devs will trust reddit after this though, the damage is done.I do hope some of the major apps will opensource and let you enter your own API key at some point.

2022-08-27 08:50:46.000	I m curious how, from a logically consistent conservative viewpoint this can be fixed The ideas that spring to mind fly smack in the face of conservative ideology- Private companies are allowed to hire who they wish. In our capitalist world the free market would provide for conservative alternatives and it does truth social versus twitter for instance - Mandating some kind of quota for conservative employees to be hired seems to fly in the face of the premise of businesses being freed from regulation and intervention by the government- Free speech protects against the government intruding on it, conservative speech included. Extending this to private companies would be a disastrous overreach of unchecked legal power- Algorithmically forcing conservative views would be seen as censorship of otherwise organic views. Conservatives claim rightly or wrongly the opposite happens, so logically they would be upset if the opposite were to happenIt seems like the only truly reasonable path is to expect conservatives to build their own platforms. Cater to their own audiences. If they are as large a group as they say they are, then the people who execute on this would become the barons of conservative thought and economics

2023-09-02 18:20:29.000	Those stylus touchscreen phones had a 640x480 or an 800x600 resolution and a full web browser. They could use basically any web site on the internet.The first iPhone had a 320x480 screen and could only use web sites that had a mobile version.I figured that access to the entire web was a killer feature that would let the clunkier stylus phones compete successfully with an iPhone. Not a prediction that aged well.
2023-11-14 17:40:01.000	So, I guess I hear you on this, although I think it s a generalization..There s certainly a trope among developers that the business doesn t give us time to do work properly, including security.. and that s it s just ship features fast ..My take on this is that it s on us, as professional developers and particularly technical leaders, to force that issue and advocate for better practices.I ve advocated for better technical practices at several jobs I ve been at, and in many cases there was no intentional desire to incentivize bad practices, it was simply that the leaders weren t aware of all the requirements, and of the consequences of cutting too many corners.When framed in the context of business value and risk, it s not as hard as you think to introduce better standards to most software development teams. Smart leaders are open to listening and changing if it means better outcomes.That said, if your technical leadership isn t interested in supporting this kind of improvement or helping you advocate, then maybe it s time to dust off the CV if you personally care about it.
2011-03-20 03:47:21.000	I think you re right, the top-level control of reddit is gone but the users have almost completely taken over that role. Reddit recently blogged about how IAmA is now the most popular subreddit and it was entirely a creation of the community.Reddit even has a strong female community which is rare for any of these sorts of sites again that wasn t created by fiat from the company but generated by the users. Reddit just needs to keep the lights on and the leadership and passion of the community will keep it going.

2019-08-09 06:35:35.000	I agree that in general statistics is more concerned about inference, while machine learning focuses on prediction. On the other hand, there is such a huge overlap between the fields that it is hard to make a distinction. Also there are statistical fields which focus more on prediction the same way as ML does. For example, in geostatistics prediction is often the only goal, e.g. to predict heavy metal concentration across a domain. People accept that it is impossible to explain every bit of spatial variation and just model it by a gaussian process the same gaussian process used in ML .

Editing the middle of a sentence, then deciding to move it to a footnote is IMO easier with di p or di Gp ¹ than with bend thumb wrist backwards arm up and to the right, drag thumb to end of sentence, double-click drag to select one word at a time to the other end, release and drag sentence down precise number of lines to next paragraph or all the way to the end of the document or how I would move the selection, Backspace, PageDown to the end, Shift Insert ¹Let me test that.

2018-06-03 15:10:59.000	While I believe I understand your position, I think we also need to address the affordability and availability of contraception as well as the existence of sex education in public schools.

2013-08-31 14:57:46.000	Be careful about making the flawed assumption that economics is a zero-sum game. That if craigslist earned money, it must somehow be stealing it.Actually, the opposite is true. I think craigslist is so focused on being barebones and profit-free that it actually is doing a disservice to the economy. It took a lot of pressure for Craigslist to add a basic feature, maps integration, and it only did so recently. If craigslist wanted to really contribute to society, it should try earning a bit more money and using it to hire people to make the service better for end-users. Everyone wins.Middle-men are not necessarily evil just because they earn a profit. A genuinely useful middle-man can benefit both himself as well as the other parties in the transaction. Again, don t fall into the trap of zero-sum thinking.

2020-11-20 19:29:27.000	There was definitely some general suspicion when we first introduced Sorbet. However, there were also some early adopters who didn t mind the syntax but really wanted the benefits. That s why we didn t push for types adoption, we allowed teams to adopt or not at their own pace. Once people saw the benefits, they wanted more of it. Syntax also stopped being a huge concern.Quoting from the blogpost - Developers get used to Sorbet syntax over time ... Our main observation is that developers enjoy Sorbet more as the typing coverage increases.On the editor integration, the funny thing is that VSCode is the only editor that needs a special extension to integrate with Sorbet. The way Sorbet supports editors is via the built-in Language Server Protocol LSP mode which can be used with any LSP plugin for any editor. I know people who are using it with Vim, Sublime Text, etc. Integration is, in a nutshell, running srb tc --lsp as a subcommand and piping data in out via stdin out. Our tool Spoom actually uses the same LSP mode to provide extra developer tools and analysis on top of Sorbet.

2024-03-08 22:20:12.000	It takes two to tango. 1. The site operator makes choices. 2. The web user makes choices. The so-called tech companies try to remove the likelihood ability of the web user to make choices. As a web user, I choose a browser that has no Javascript engine. Nor does it auto-load resources. Yet I read the full article and saw no popups. The website operator has provided detailed alt descriptions for each image.1 The 1.2 MiB statically-compiled browser I m using does not come from a so-called tech company or any of their business partners Mozilla Google business partner . As such, no need for uBO.If one takes a position that no web user should change their choices, then IMHO this detracts from any pleas to website operators to change their choices.Further, if one argues against web users changing their choices, e.g., a commenter suggests that all web users should always auto-load all resources in a web page and run all Javascript, then this only provides more incentive for website operators to include lots of commercially-oriented garbage in their pages.Truthfully, there is no need to use AI to avoid popups. There are simpler solutions.1. If for some reason I want to look at the cartoons I can download each image with a single keystroke and view them without using any Javascript.To read the alt descriptions, text-only, no Javascript, no popups, without a browser tnftp -o grep -o alt . quot class sed s alt . s . 13 s quot g tr n fmt

Optional console add-ons rarely gain any traction, and while Sony made a great demo unit, they have plenty of money to make powerful, fancy prototypes. There s no way of knowing what the actual consumer units will be like until they actually create a product out of it.Oculus started basic and is improving because that s all they could afford to do, given their need to release actual usable, mass produced hardware to backers. Sony started huge, and now they ll see how they can distill that down to a mass-producible item. And that probably won t be for a year or two.So yeah, they have competition now, but Oculus did not sell because they were afraid of a shiny demo. It s not a product yet, and there s no guarantee that it ever will be.

I was listening in to some of the calls Mike was making, and he told me about others, and it was apparent that another journalist had the same story a month earlier, but had been convinced not to publish it.There were entire blogs dedicated to covering the space, but nobody said a word about users getting ripped off with misleading scams.

This is an easy rule to remember and to teach people.The actual explanation for this is a little complex and includes things like the average person s vocabulary, known sentence structure inc. transition words, language itself, and enigma cracking techniques.The biggest criticism phrase based passwords receive is that people go from an 8 character random password to a three word phrase-based password and then act like they ve improved security because it contains more characters.Phrase based passwords can be secure with a little bit of education, even against the best available crackers.

Whatever I knew of Indian mythology was mostly through festivals, stories told by elders during childhood and some children s books. Norse felt pretty much tribal in comparison and Greek was a bit better than Norse, still it felt short of childhood memories. So I started to dig up more about Indian, and boy it took me a while in wikipedia figuring out the chronology and even the different kinds of literature that existed, a real rabbit hole. I have just about started out and got a long way to go.

It can be information used to shape a narrative, factually correct or not.Anyway this new word malinformation helps if it means we really need to distinguish between all three words.Also these China-style crackdowns on people shaping political narrative via social media is ridiculous.

The sociologist took his map and phone book and set out to chart which corporate headquarters had gone where and why. Contrary to official rationales, which emphasized corporate enhancement or a disinterested pursuit of the great outdoors, Whyte found that most of the new campus compounds were sited within eight or nine miles of the CEO s home a chilling and widely broadcast statistic that jarred with corporate claims about humane treatment for those uprooted in the move.

I meant sites that started on old react and kept trying to keep up with all of the newest best practices throughout the years are slow. Typically because they do too much on the webapp and don t treat it as a gui only. The last web app I looked at in the old job was literally as much code as the entire backing service for it. I don t know how to justify that.And yeah, for public sites, tracking almost certainly dominates how slow things are. I was thinking of internal tooling sites. I remember how fast many of the tools were when I started at the last job. I also remember how slow all of them were getting as I was leaving said job. It is more than a touch insane.

Also I wouldn t get to tinker with hardware and do some of the more exotic things like exposing GPIO pins to Kubernetes workloads, and if I ran home automation workloads there, they d be useless if my uplink fails.But if this was work, I d do things differently for sure.

I have coached a number of folks who seemed to feel strangely disempowered, which is to say that the world had to change job opening appears, company moves to their area, etc in order for them to make progress on their goals.I ve had some success at simplifying the question using the common trick of assuming solutions to the presumptive problems. So for example starting with Ok lets stipulate that there is a million dollars in a bank vault that is paying you 1,200 a month in free money. And you re living in an area where that pays all your food, rent, and gas. Now, what do you want to do with your time? That gets us past blaming the economy and taking ownership of what they want to do. It is a different way of thinking, but it gets out of the rut of answer based thinking.Life is like riding a train that you know is on a track with a bridge out over a 1000 chasm. When the train gets there, it will fall into the chasm, and everyone on board will die. Given that every train you could take from a station has this same feature what train do you pick? Who do you pick to ride with you? What places does the train need to go through before it gets to the missing bridge?Sometimes it isn t as complicated as what do you want to do with your life, it is simply what can you do today that is fulfilling to you?
2016-10-10 14:50:35.000	Apple marketing simply has succeeded in convincing you and others that there is no viable alternative which in turn keeps you from accepting such a possibilitySpeaking of FUD. Marketing only gets you so far, and at some point you have to have a product. I have tried to switch to Android. First with an HTC One and another time with the Nexus 5 I also have a Nexus 7 . Android definitely wins on open and customization, but on overall system it continually failed. My Nexus 5 would randomly get system processes spinning out of control and if I didn t notice, I would have a dead battery in 10 minutes. I don t remember which, but there was an Android update that made my Nexus 7 completely unusable.I went back to the iPhone, and only then fully realized Apple s advantage of controlling the hardware AND software. I think Google is finally recognizing this, and attempting to replicate it with the Pixel.

How long do you think that lasted? Wait and see how long before Seattle adjusts the minimum down.

2018-06-15 12:20:24.000	Personally I am very interested in both how models can help solve business problems and how to make effectively engineered tools for machine learning.In my work I spend a lot of time on new deep learning architectures or experimenting with modifications or fine-tuning or ensembling.I write a lot of container and Makefile tooling to ensure experiments are reproducible and results have identifiers that map back to the full set of data, software and parameters.I also write a lot of backend server software to wrap trained models in a web application, mostly in Python, and do a lot of work with Cython after profiling to target only those spots of the code that reveal actual performance bottlenecks in terms connected directly to a specific business problem s latency or throughput requirements as in, not taking the huge premature optimization step of assuming a whole system needs to be written in C , and instead using profiling and case-by-case diagnostics to know when to write something as an optimized C extension module callable from Python for very specific and localized sections of code.My experience has been that there is such a lack of transparency about how deployment will work, how performance will work, etc., when using cookie cutter pipeline approaches, like sklearn Pipelines, TensorFlow serving, Fargate, etc. You ll always need to break some assumption of the pipeline, layer in new diagnostics, debug latency issues, etc., on a case-by-case basis.99 of the time, ease of specifying a new model or articulating an experiment is not hard, requires little dev work, and only represents about 10 of the actual work needed to explore a model s appropriateness for a given problem at hand.The rest requires very specialized control and visibility to basically perform application-specific surgery on the pipeline, customizing and tailoring many aspects, from how multi-region deployment should look to how optimized the web service code should be to whether to use asynchronous workers or a queuing service to stage and process requests, to optimizing preprocessing treatments, to instrumenting some extra New Relic metric tracking that the pipeline isn t extensible enough to just specify in some config, and so on.What s been most important is that the deep learning engineers on the team, who are researchers, are also excellent system engineers at all those topics too and display a high degree of curiosity towards them, and absolutely do not look at it like boring work that distracts from the experimentation they would rather do. Their value add is not driven by spending more time experimenting that s virtually never the case. Their value add is in both knowing the details of the deep learning models intimately while also knowing the deep details of implementation, optimization, deployment, and diagnostics.In that sense, tying model development to a cookie cutter pipeline framework, whether Spark or sklearn or something custom in-house, is something I believe strongly is an anti-pattern.

Additionally change means a very different thing when you are talking about in-flexible data 3d models, textures, animation etc , and usually means throwing the data away completely and starting over.

2022-03-22 12:46:09.000	I suppose that s true in a way. There would have to be some serious scaffolding for it to work though. For a web service, for example, libraries would have to be able to register route handlers and such that they handle independently. Perhaps they could all be initialized in a common way using DI or something from a base gateway application. Versioning and interop testing would have to be figured out in some clever way.Something like this would be the architecture I imagine.

Logging in the flexible environment can also be a bit lacking. When you have something running in standard runtimes you basically don t have to think about many of the things that can normally go wrong on a server.That said, many things about the flexible environment are rapidly improving, they ve certainly come a long way since we first started playing with them around 6 months ago.

Fine-tuning is better suited to teaching specialized tasks or styles, and is less reliable for factual recall. ... In contrast, message inputs are like short-term memory. When you insert knowledge into a message, it s like taking an exam with open notes. With notes in hand, the model is more likely to arrive at correct answers.

2020-09-11 19:56:03.000	This article is so odd in its conclusion. The problem lies in obscurity generating a mess thats hard to reason around by designers, hiding obvious weakpoints, making it hard to find the most valuable area to work on. Changing from a default port should not really count as this since its easily configurable and does not impact neither the design nor usability unless it does . Port scanning avoidance also fills an actual function in terms of load issues.Rather what seem to be the issue is what security by obscurity actually means and can be missinterpreted as.Layering lots of obscurity and putting time on that when it can be spent to increase security in the actual weakpoints or and hiding them for developers maintainers are problematic to say the least.

2023-03-11 08:48:53.000	Really? You really find it that difficult? might be slower but just click on every magnet on there and see which one is quickest Took 5 seconds to find those.You could google top torrent sites , enter one search and be watching that show in less time than it took you to write that comment.As others have said, it would take me a lot longer to find out which of the myriad streaming services actually have that show, and what device app I need to actually watch that streaming service.

I offer the value of my labor in exchange for money, and it would be nice if there were some coincidence of wants between myself and the persons directing my labor, but the idea that this should naturally exist, well -- that seems to have worn a bit thin in recent decades. I m not even entirely sure that my current employer has my best interests at heart -- and I m self-employed
2024-07-21 10:51:36.000	But EVs can charge from renewable sources and then they don t have any fuel-related emissions.That was my point. Maybe the paragraph order was confusing. Roads are used for going from where people live to where they want to go.They or stroads, or highways shouldn t be used in place of streets. A city should have the minimal set of roads to get the job done, everything else should be traffic calmed streets.

Switching from one browser to the next can typically be done in minutes, so reading something like So if you want an Internet --- which means, in many ways, a world --- that isn t controlled by Google, you must stop using Chrome nowmakes me think the author of the article has a huge chip on his shoulder.This not the right tone for this kind of discussion.

2023-07-18 18:57:18.000	I think OKRs are required to communicate intent and targets. It is a great way for communication across and upwards .But it is a shitty tool downwards . Suddenly you have managers insisting that a feature must be rolled out before the 31st of March, even though rolling out 2 days later will be safer.It creates perverse incentives such as OKRs used for individual performance reviews when in reality, a lot of work is team x-team group effort. It causes ICs to play corporate games.

You don t get to work there. You don t own anything, in fact, except the stock share.No, its a polite fiction that a share is related to the business. Its related to the right to bet on the business performance, and a little bit more. If the business fails, you have certain rights. If its sold, your share is handled specially.That the return doesn t go into your bank account is especially damning. The company money is entirely kept separate from your money, because they are not legally related.Dividends are a red herring, used by few companies and factored in out of the stock price near the dividend date. Stock buybacks are another anomaly. The company can decide at any time that you don t own your share, they want it back!There have to be special rules put into place to avoid abuse during buybacks, mergers etc. Because otherwise the non-existant connection between the share and the company would be exploited to the fullest, by leaving the shareholders out of the money entirely. SO rules get made to force the company to pretend the share is meaningful.

2023-05-04 14:20:00.000	The Georgian model of land taxation is interesting.Not sure i agree with the moralist approach that land isn t something we should fight and war over. It s a resource like anything else, and if when it comes down to it, people will fight. It would be a luxury to implement a Georgian taxation system because that s only viable because the nation doing so has fought and defended that very land. It doesn t scale endlessly, but even so, it s something that should be looked at as something a nation could do to improve its internal quality of life!

2017-03-21 19:36:30.000	If your mental model for how the economy works somehow doesn t allow the situationsMy mental model certainly allows for the situations such as evictions and landlords making money because that much is obvious just by looking around.However, my mental model will not accept the journalist s headline claiming that the Problem of poverty is that it s Profitable . That makes no sense. To test the journalist s assertion, just flip the words around the Solution to poverty is to make it Money-Losing! This means that to solve poverty , the landlord charges less than the cost of maintenance property taxes interest on loans etc. Eventually, the landlord s bank account leaks away until the landlord herself is in poverty. And who then steps up to lose money to solve the landlord s poverty? The city accepts less property tax payments than it costs to maintain roads, schools, and salaries of the government staff? The grocery store accepts less payment than the cost of milk and bread? And who solves the poverty of the workers of the city government and grocery store that were laid off? How do we keep this chain of everybody losing money going so poverty is solved?

2018-11-07 19:15:22.000	So for now, the Pittsburgh native and father to young children is living with his mother In the past that wasn t so much of an option. You had to survive. I grew up with parents working jobs like the one he eschewed. They wouldn t dare try to live with my comparatively much more wealthy grandma.So now living with your parents into your 30s is like taking basic income. This is all fine if someone is truly doing this to invest in more education to get out of the unskilled labor market, but bad when it is just an excuse to be lazy. I too worked low wage jobs when I was a teen and in college to pay my way, I find that when people leave the upward trajectory by leaving school or their job for something better they end up becoming lazy and end up worse.

With the rise of scientific thinking, we re seeing a rapid increase in the number of folks who identify as agnostic or atheist.

Satellites target ICBMs. Bombers and ICBMs target factories, cities, bases, and defcon. Bombers target in that order ICBMs seem to target randomly.Game over when defcon is destroyed.Launching an ICBM requires defcon Defcon changes to 4, 3, 2, and 1 if a bombers crosses the circular boundaries radar? around the center.

2014-10-22 06:20:15.000	Motion of the poles has sped up quite dramatically in the past century. That 50 km year is up from almost zero in the late 1800 s and 15 km year in the early 1900 s.So it isn t entirely out there to worry a bit out reversal. Current thinking is that the Earth s magnetic field becomes multi-polar during reversals, but field strength won t dramatically diminish. So if it does happen, it ll complicate some things, and no doubt result in some economic activity, but won t be the end of the world.

So you could redo the socket to 240V without running new cable through your walls.You d need an extra conductor of wire than is there in the cable for a standard 240V outlet. Hot1, Hot2, Neutral, Gnd .You can run a Hot1 Hot2 240V circuit with existing 14 2 romex, but odds are that whatever feeds the outlet in your kitchen also feeds many other outlets, and you don t want them all to be 240V.Note North America doesn t use ring circuits like the UK.

2019-04-11 11:41:08.000	I think every single one of US government s espionage charges over the past several decades ended in settlements.Why would a government so keen on accusing people of espionage and no doubt wanting to set a precedent for various things being classified as espionage such as leaks , settle so easily?Well, because the charges have always been bogus and they know it. Daniel Ellsberg of the Pentagon Papers fame has made it extremely difficult if not downright impossible for the government to win in such cases.If the US government will succeed in sentencing Assange, it won t be due to a espionage charge, but something else entirely, or at best, yet another plea bargain.

It benefited the United States even before it was the United States, as people was encouraging to stay in the country during the duration of exclusivity, and gave the country a working model of the invention so people could learn. Before patents, many invention was treated as city or state secret.I can recommend a very interesting talk by Professor Eben Moglen, who teach law history and actually read discussions that happened between the people who wrote and worked with the first implementation of the US patent law

2019-08-27 09:01:52.000	A question interesting to me Are cruise ships worse or better than package, tour or individual holidays?We have millions of people all over the world who want to travel and see the world and enjoy themselves. Assuming we don t ban individual travel we probably want to work out the most environmentally friendly and socially responsible way of enabling this.A network of railway lines across the northern hemisphere connecting to a fleet of wind powered cruise ships? But paying staff a socially responsible wage might push the cost of a holiday up above the once a year point. And figuring in the real environmental cost would cause issues as well.

A few years ago, I traveled around Africa, including Uganda, using public buses an adventure in itself and they would frequently show movies or music videos. Many of the music videos were local hip hop artists, rap music often blended with local traditions. The music videos were no different form the bling-bling videos in the US and you can tell they all needed at least one white girl. Obviously, there were must not have been many options, so for the majority it was some girl that I would not label as music video attractive. My assumption was that they must have been the local Peace Core volunteer.Kampala, like most African cities, is incredibly hectic. Not sure how he found someone randomly.

2014-08-18 02:13:11.000	VCs provide access to small growth businesses and will never have a lack of passive investors because that sector should be a great profit engine. When one set of passive investors tires out due to the funds mediocre performance, there ll be another set of suckers coming down the line.The most underreported self-dealing by the VC class isn t the 2-and-20, but the revolving door between VC firms and overpaid executive positions at VC-funded companies. Being a partner at a VC means you get a lot of executive positions to hand out to your B-school friends who turned out to be underachievers. This means that a bunch of people will owe you favors, 10 years down the line. This type of personal draw-out funding suboptimal businesses to win future favors from founders and other VCs, rather than the best is also impossible to prove or even measure.VCs draw a decent salary for themselves, but the personal career benefits of being a king-maker which are impossible to track are even bigger. The savvy ones essentially assure that they ll become two- or three-digit millionaires billions is unpredictable and hard to assure you typically have to go all-in on your own company in the next bubble cycle. You can t not get rich if you re a VC, and for 95-99 of these guys, I could do their jobs better and I m a 31-year-old relative nobody.For better or worse, they re the main and perhaps the only reliable one valve between top talent and the ocean of passive capital seeking better returns than what index funds offer, and they re not going to give that up.It s a Cheap Votes Problem. Why is it illegal to sell one s vote? Because, even if the statistical power of one vote is low, the statistical power of a bloc of votes can be quite high voting blocs grow quadratically in contribution to variance . If you allow vote-buying, the people who aggregate cheap votes gain a ridiculous amount of power. This was a major problem in the Gilded Age. Venture capitalists are cheap vote aggregators when it comes to passive capital and high-talent business formation.
2021-03-04 14:30:22.000	Pretty much all the repairs I ve had to do on my cars would still need to happen on EVs.In fact, with the exception of a clutch, every time any car I ve owned has broken down its been a part which is common on EVs.EVs still have dampers, ball joints, springs, brakes, wheel bearings, steering alignment. They still have power steering motors, lights, wing mirrors, windscreens. Those are all things I ve replaced at some point.EVs still corrode. EVs still have design flaws which mean water leaks into the cabin. EVs still have wiring issues perhaps more! . EVs also weigh significantly more, which means the suspension has to work harder.I m sure EVs require _less_ maintenance especially when they re less than 10 years old , and not having to do an annual mileage based service is nice. But the idea that they re maintenance free is just nonsense. No car is.
2014-02-04 04:34:05.000	Yes, perhaps a month was optimistic. Looking back through my emails, I see it took me 5 months in my spare time to design my language and instruction set and develop the compiler and VM. After that I wrote the function libraries. This was the first and only compiler I ve written, and I just bought a book on compiler construction to figure out how to do it. This was an object-oriented C-like language, which was general purpose. It took a few years of actually using the language to make it instustrial strength .Writing a compiler is a lot simpler than people might think. I used Practice and Principles of Compiler Building With C , which explains things very well. It seems to be out of print now.

2009-06-11 01:10:07.000	I don t understand the logic flow of this article. First it seems to place to place freemium micro billing in opposition. I don t see why.Then it goes on to describe all sorts of problems that might affect a freemium model. They can be annoying. There s a race to the bottom. There s the penny gap. paid subsidises free. All true. None universally applicable. Certainly none universally deal breakers.To pick on the last one I could give this analogy that applies to many kinds of freemium businesses. Whenever you buy your brand of toothpaste that you have been buying for 20 years you are subsidising advertising to new markets in countries you don t care abut. In other cases even that analogy doesn t hold because free customers do not raise costs.When finally getting back to microbilling, the solution appears to be some sort of universal easy micro billing service a cultural shift away from subscriptions towards pay-as-you-go. Fine. Good. Works for iphone apps mobile phone trivia, why not web apps?What relevance does this have for business models that rely on freemium? None. No such service exists at this point. The fact that the proposed solution is a universal one, points to the fact that WebApp companies shouldn t roll their own.I agree that micro billing is a good idea. I don t see what it has to do with freemium.

Adding new APIs was a huge pain in the ass, you had to write all of this ugly bridge code in Objective C, and the APIs ended up being super unnatural on the JS side. As a result, desktop integration wasn t done much since it felt like a Black Magic type thing. Writing new APIs in Electron is Just JavaScript, so you can make something much more natural. We could literally do fuck-all for people running old versions of macOS - you can t upgrade Safari on old machines, you just Get What You Get.

All the exploits were used to finally install and run an old-style NPAPI plugin.Just like ActiveX, these are binary code that usually runs outsidE of any sandboxing due to compatibility reasons.With NaCL or just the advances in HTML and related technologies, this kind of plugin really should have outlived its usefulness by now and maybe it s time to drop support - at least support for all plugins but a few whitelisted ones from the older ages.Like Flash and maybe QuickTime though both have a terrible security track record .Though considering the persistence of piling up bugs that was happening here, for all we know, there would have been a different exploit somewhere else that could have worked even without NPAPI. It would just close one more attack surface.

They are independent entities all their own.Further, they can only exist because the government grants them that privilege, and the government can technically place any restrictions they like on them. In the past, the government used to require that the corporation serve the public good as part of the conditions for their existence.I don t think it s right or accurate to characterize corporations as just groups of people and therefore they should have the rights of people. The law and the courts don t think so, either, which is why corporations are treated differently with fewer rights than people are.

The NT kernel has always been fairly agnostic and not tied specifically to Win32 it originally had an OS 2 text-mode and POSIX subsystem in addition to Win32. The NT kernel even uses a Unix-like ? root filesystem where disks, kernel objects, sockets, etc are mounted.From what I can gather Microsoft is paying Canonical to help with a few user-mode bits and the Windows apt-get stuff uses the official Canonical sources.As I said to him NT is the only major OS I know of that has always had personality subsystems.

2016-03-24 12:52:27.000	There are always bad sides to things. Yet I personally see the good parts of GitHub largely outweighing the bad parts. GitHub wants to control your projects on GitHubSo because they have become popular GitHub now wants to control everyone? Sounds more paranoid than anything else. developers have become enslaved by a large company telling them how to do their project managementGitHub provides limited ways to manage your project, but it s not mandatory! Disable the issue tracker and wiki, and use whatever management tools you want. Also just because he doesn t like the project management tools GitHub provides, doesn t imply that everyone has been enslaved and forced to use it. It can be very useful and comes at no cost and not setup required for Open Source projects. CensorshipSuch an overused word. GitHub is not obligated to protect your rights for freedom of speech. They have Terms of Service and if they judge something as not fitting for their platforms, they have the right to remove it. That is not censorship.Whether the DMCA requests where legitimate or not, is in my opinion something lawyers should deal with and not random partially biased internet users. Terms of ServiceThe goal of ToS is to protect the company which in turn protects the whole user base from bad users. Again the ToS are not here to provide you security or protection, but it lays out how you can use the service and what rights GitHub keeps in case you re determined to be a bad user.What I m missing from the post is an alternative - if not GitHub what then? Because I m sure you ll find similar points for any other Git repository hosting company, which leaves you with self-hosting. But for self-hosting people usually forget to calculate for the time spent setting things up, maintaining it and making sure everything is secure. Especially regarding security I d personally trust a company more than co-worker who knows something about Linux and servers or myself.

2020-05-08 18:23:34.000	My question to people who think this is objectively a bad thing - given the usual line of thought to get that conclusion is that we shouldn t be prejudiced towards valuing humans any more than other living creatures which makes sense , then why would the replacement of non-human biomass with human biomass necessarily be good or bad?Now I kinda know some sensible answers to this question. For one, genetic diversity in life is critical for survival given diversification means at least a few strands can survive sudden unexpected events. i.e if everything were giant dinosaurs there may have been no life left after the dinosaur extinction. The other answer is that we are pre-built to aesthetically enjoy thriving nature which is probably meant to drive us towards protecting genetic diversity .However given the human backlash to human trashing the environment, I could easily see us settling on an equilibrium where life is not, at least for the most part, the kind of wild chaotic world that it was before us, but a world where the environment is increasingly managed to some degrees by humans. You see this as nations getting richer stop eating cats, dogs, care more about preserving the environment, raising better treated wildlife, etc.In that case, perhaps humans can help facilitate a new epoch in nature where genetic diversity is not just a biproduct of a random process, but a conscious goal. Granted this would require a much deeper knowledge of nature, humility to know when we can t control everything, and a cultural shift towards being stewards of nature. But given the shifts that have already occurred in human thinking around nature, I don t think this is outside the realm of possibility. Given our increasing energy usage, it s probably the only route in which we don t end up causing environmental catastrophes that either kill us off, or our civilization. That and finding new planets.

2014-05-13 18:01:44.000	Put that way, I fully agree. If I were to hire programmers for my company, I d rather have a few like yourself than a bunch of Rails devs that don t really know Ruby nor Rails internals for example . And I ve worked at a bunch of places where the effects of using frameworks without fully understanding them were readily apparent.I took issue mostly with the blanket statement that frameworks are bad, because I think there s a lot of variety. Backbone, for example, is so basic that it might be useful for master programmers, whereas Rails is a monster framework that is a bitch to handle if you get to that 10 . And I d argue React, which is more of a library, could be a very useful abstraction that leaves you free to do things your own way, or even replace it eventually. But I might be wrong about that! I m not a master...Also, I guess in the context of the framework library-explosion it makes sense that you d point out the problems with a little less nuance .

If she s tasked with receiving allegations then their legal team will be interested in knowing exactly what is believed and what accusations are on the table. They definitely do not want some clerical worker faking a story and masking issues that have a real chance of being substantiated or argued in a court case someday. If I m lying or fabricating then they d also want a reliable record in their favor in court. The reporting office is motivated for accuracy and that s exactly why she challenged my facts, so that I could reinforce them through repetition and clarification.

2023-10-10 12:58:20.000	I agree the pain of rebuilding characteristic to large software is not inherent to software in general. Software can be highly modular, allowing for fast and flexible changes of many important parts. You don t have to rebuild a Linux or Windows kernel to update a driver usually you don t even need to reboot it.But Firefox specifically, and a few other old, large, and highly multiplatform projects had more important things to do than to make building them easy, and in doing so made contributing to them harder.It s like a Honda Civic vs some Jaguar.

2018-04-23 06:28:15.000	To me, renting vs. buying is a bit like AWS vs. own bare metal in a rack.With AWS, you can have 1G RAM or 10000G RAM or anything in between, you can move between data centers without much trouble, and you can cancel virtually anytime. Once you spent on your own metal, you re stuck with it.Renting gives so much flexibility, and even if it s a bit more expensive in the long run, flexibility pays. Of course, there are scenarios when you don t want to rent e.g. having kids or elderly parents living together.

Perhaps this can be improved closer to git with git extensions, e.g. implementing some sort of ranking and filtration system. Related to that is users should not really have to change the structure of the VCS itself just to filter messages.

2009-11-02 20:30:24.000	I think that s a slippery slope to go down as far as what is predatory vendor lock-in and what is not. It is most definitely vendor lock-in if you had to use an iPod 200 with a Mac because the software only works on Apple hardware 600, can break and may need to be replaced within a year . Whereas with OSX, you purchase it with the intent to use it on your Mac that already came preloaded with an older version of OSX.Does the software work on PC? Sort of, but it s unsupported. Should they be forced to support it? Probably not, because it may heavily impact their business model, bottom line, and stability. What if they don t want the no-name-brand manufacturer to make customers think their product OSX sucks?The fact is that Microsoft locks in customers by mere quantity. OSX has prestige and quality, but it requires the customer to acknowledge they don t have a genuine choice in hardware vendors unless they want to manipulate it into working although I do think Apple s license is dumb with regard to saying it can t be pre installed on a PC .

2022-08-01 11:20:38.000	If you google passwordless, biometric solutions are one way to go, hence I mentioned them, not because I wad trying to put it into your mouth.If someone has access to my password they either got it by torture, a non or insufficient hashed store on the other end or by breaking encryption.A simple dongle that may not even need a password, is easier to get.2FA can make sense, passwordless does not.The risk of 3rd party screwing up, doesn t go away, it s just shifted to another 3rd party, which again, you have to trust.I use a different email address with a unique password for anything that s important and where another person having access could harm me. Forums and such are not a part of that.So let s agree to disagree. I ll stay with passwords for everything that s important and for most things that are really important, apart from banking that is, I don t even have a 3rd party involved.

I don t get to choose how much weight to lift or how many reps to do it s all determined by my progression in the program which is figured out at the beginning of my 9-week cycle .For anyone with ADD, executive dysfunction, or just general procrastination, this is a great way to reduce the number of decision points that give you an opportunity to break your new habit.Also I recommend following through with the final 2 weeks. They can be really hard, but when you then take 14 days off and see yourself get in noticeably better shape during a period of sitting on the couch, you buy into the program big time.

2018-12-10 17:30:20.000	Have you considered that nothing really changed with how much attention people give to movies? You are only looking at your friend s behavior, and assuming that the story would change if you lived in another decade. You can t rule out that even in the days where movies were only shown in a theater, that maybe 10 of the audience was paying enough attention to truly appreciate the film and not distracted with other thoughts. Being an active and engaged watcher is difficult work, and it can be as hard as analytical reading for many people. Cell phones and the internet also didn t invent trite, low effort, distracting content that stuff is as old as writing.
2024-01-05 15:43:44.000	Complicated. There are essentially 5 possibilities - ports are subprocesses acting as erlang processes- erl_interface is a more efficient version of the same as the communication uses BEAM s external term format- C nodes are what it sounds like, basically a separate program acting as a node in a beam cluster- port drivers have a shared library acting as a process, it s way more efficient but jettisons safety as a crash in the library kills the runtime- finally NIFs are synchronous functions called in the context of an existing process, they are the fastest option but not only do they kill the emulator they can also screw up the VM state, and they can t be managed by the scheduler without their cooperation which can severely degrade system stability , BEAM has a concept of dirty NIFs which are long-running, can t be suspended, and can t be threaded, if those are appropriately flagged they are run on dedicated dirty schedulers , dirty schedulers have more overhead but less restrictions, in essence cgo is a more impactful version of that although I believe dirty schedulers were invented a while after cgo existed, previously dirty nifs would just see you drawn and quartered

Try a few scrap bits before working on something expensive...It s nice to be able to swap things out with sockets, and you ll generally find me coming down on the side of repairability, but it exists with a variety of other considerations, and something that is less repairable, but also far less likely to fail in the first place, may be a better option. Also, I rather like the fact that soldered on RAM makes things like coldboot attacks a lot harder to pull off if you re using trusted boot.Heavy use of adhesives is certainly a problem, but I just can t get that worked up over soldered on RAM.

The Tera MTA project was actually BSD based, because it was from an age where the BSD project had clear technical superiority and they were probably worried about complying with the GPL As others have mentioned there was a Mellanox stack in Free circa 2005 that I worked with. It was used at Isilon BSD based in production.There really isn t a technical discussion here at all, when an overwhelmingly large part of your userbase uses X, it would be pretty stupid to only support Y, and probably not defensible to support X and Y

2018-08-07 15:27:35.000	It s about economics. Climate change keeps being presented as something we need to make huge sacrifices to do something about, and this does not work. The unwillingness to make such sacrifices, we may find reprehensible when it comes from the rich who could easily afford it, and more sympathetic when it comes from people who are barely keeping their heads above water as it stands, and reasonably suspect they would end up in a pauper s grave and never see the future they were supposed to be defending, but whether we agree with it or not, that is people s revealed preference.So the narrative needs to stop being about sacrifice, and start being about jobs. The immense task of converting the world to renewable energy, has the potential to create millions upon millions of badly-needed jobs. It needs to start being sold that way.

I could go from my home network-wise in allegedly Quebec City to my cell phone which showed as a town about 50 miles away from my actual location to Kansas in 10 minutes. If places banned based on these kinds of Geo-IP databases I d be banned from most of the internet.

2021-10-16 21:19:27.000	I disagree that your reasoning is entirely sound. It s a bit of an elitist point of view I suppose but fundamentally I don t think all customers are created equally in terms of importance. One could even in this day and age call some of the more important ones influencer or something similar.While the general customer base might not be served by this feature, what if a subset of the customer base enjoys this feature to an extraordinary extent? Maybe it fixes a lot of problems they have with the service and negates a lot of complaints they otherwise would have posted.Would it still not be the correct choice to clutter the UI with this?I don t think it s as easy of a choice like you re trying to make it.But I could also be jaded by the fact that Spotify for years has trying to pull me into listening to all kinds of odd European folk music that I have no interest in what-so-ever.

2022-03-29 03:22:25.000	Its definitely interesting to consider something like that. Stats as to why might be cool, but odds are nothing is going to change my mind. I am actually more curious about how many users on my list end up getting banned for being bots eventually.There used to be a tool I think called something like block with me, where you could follow other users block lists. Although I can t seem to find it any more. Options like that would certainly be interesting. But Twitter isn t incentivized to do something like that.

2023-05-11 18:22:37.000	Here s an interesting talk related to app workers working collectively question I wish the authors of this paper had asked, which seems like a key question to me is Why do keep working on this platform if it pays so little? Why not get another job? If it s because they cannot find any other employment and this is the only work they can find sometimes the case for newcomers to the country etc. , then removing gig jobs would appear to result in them having no employment at all.In many cases I might even guess most cases people do work through these apps because they allow a level of flexibility people cannot typically get from other jobs. If you work at Nandos you can t decide to take the morning off or work a couple extra hours during some downtime, you can t stay home a few days if your child is sick or childcare falls through and pick up working again once the disruption abates or unilaterally decide to switch from morning to evening hours for a few days.Some people just don t like dealing with coworkers and a boss. In any event, I think the why behind peoples decisions to do these jobs is highly relevant, and I think that the flexibility these gigs provide should be factored in when comparing them to a job at a grocery store or something, as it seems like an apples to oranges comparison.

2024-05-26 08:08:40.000	In 2013, I had an internship at a kind of industrial incubator and fund in Kongsberg, Norway Although that was 11 years ago now, and a lot has certainly changed in the industry, physics has not.At the time, they had an explicit focus on alternative energy technologies, so recieved a lot of proposals similar to this. I do not remember the details of my analyses anymore, but I do remember that every single one of them was rejected because none of them passed a basic back-of-the-envelope plausibility evaluation.These projects basically fail because their output is poor compared to other solutions of similar or even lower cost.It is also important to consider how much energy it takes to manufacture their solution in the first place. How long does it take for them to actually become net carbon negative? Does it even happen in the lifetime of the product? Sometimes the answer is no in which case, what is even the point?

It says The Precambrian Canadian Shield that stores vast mineral deposits is 2.7 billion years old, and once formed an ocean floor. - so I guess this water got trapped while the ocean floor was subducted or overlaid with sediments or whatever happened that brought it to its current depth?! So it s not the H2O molecules, but the whole liquid which has stayed there for that amount of time.Referring back to your original question, it would be fascinating to find out what percentage of the water molecules in circulation on Earth today date back to the time when water first condensed out of the atmosphere IIRC 4 billion years ago - but I m not sure if that s possible.

2016-08-05 01:45:19.000	It is only with the advent of civilization , i.e. agriculture, that we find great power differentials, including the power of men over womenThat is exactly what I m saying. Do you somehow contend that hunter-gatherers societies are more likely to have left written records that have survived to today?
2012-06-27 06:39:07.000	you had 4.2kw in a rack at he.net? I didn t parse that. ah. You must have had 3 racks or at least 3 15a circuits as that d be about that much power usable.they d only sell me 1 15a 120v circuit, which is 12a usable 1.44Kw. Something like 500 month before bandwidth, 347 per Kw.Compare that to 600 month for 20a 120v at svtix I m going to charge you 650, and throw in some bandwidth if you buy from me. If you go direct with the guy that runs the place, maybe you can do better, maybe not, but you ll definitely spend more time negotiating with him than with me. that s 16a usable, 1.92Kw. 339 or so per Kw retail, including 10Mbps bandwidth. I m not saying my prices are great I think my prices are a reasonable no haggle deal. compare this to the quote from BAIS in santa clara for 11.5kw.. 6x20a 120v circuits in a single 47u rack... 96a usable, for two grand, that s 174 per Kw. Of course, at that point you are paying extra for higher density servers, though, and the up front price was rather higher. The power at Svtix has been solid for me, and the owner of the data center keeps it way colder than it needs to be. Which, I guess, is good marketing? but it costs money 70-80F isn t going to kill a modern server.I think that he.net fremont is a fine temperature 80 degree temps aren t going to hurt your servers. much above that and you worry but the power at fremont 1, at least, has been horrible. I have two legacy racks there that I m trying to get out of, and man, they ve gone down three times in the last two years, which is horrible by the standards of such things. Once, the power surge when the power came back toasted one of my servers.It was miserable. One of those this is why you should get dedicated servers rather than co-locating your own stuff experiences. I screwed up the configuration on my PDU, so my stuff didn t come online after the first outage I was paged and had to leave a party. I fix it, and then the next day early, if I remember correctly, or maybe it just seemed early the power went out again, and this time it fried one of my servers, so I had to shuffle in, zombie-like, and swap it out with a spare.

After you call Reset , you re still getting the value from the first firing, because that s the first time you read from the channel at all.The docs are quite clear on this behavior and say Timer will send the current time on its channel after at least duration d. -- key words being at least and says nothing about when you choose to read from the channel.

2011-12-23 15:05:48.000	I think GoDaddy is outright wrong. SOPA PIPA won t benefit GoDaddy at all. It will actually hurt them because less startups means less people registering their domain, and therefore less profits for GoDaddy.

Twitter also publicizes all of its suspensions and bans. There s a Wikipedia article with a list of all the notable suspensions since 2010. It s interesting to see that, contrary to popular narratives, many of the international groups banned were actually far-left aligned.The list gets really boring the more you scroll down however. The last notable ban was Paul Graham for simply sharing their Mastodon handle. A boring dystopia indeed

2019-11-04 23:36:47.000	I think you are right! The whole identity of thinking of yourself as engineering type is likely fulfilling some emotional need to belong to a group you perceive as superior.However, I m also certain the hipster-corporatist brand aesthetic of products like Slack is exactly part of the appeal. It definitely signals that slack is a tool used by a certain tribe. And if you aspire to be in that tribe, this tool is for you. Call it the tribe of life-work optimizers and the open office, if you will.

2022-04-06 23:13:54.000	Rather, as with programming languages, the first five paradigms are the hardest. As a native Scandinavian, I understand most Scandinavian except Finnish without having spent more than fifty hours with various Scandinavians, and without having attempted to learn much. It s mostly deciphering dialects, remapping certain words. Having unwillingly learned German as a child, I can enjoy German television and navigate German cities as a confident, talkative tourist. Having learned fluent Esperanto, I can decipher a bunch of words in French and Italian, but can t follow conversation.As for Chinese, 1.5 years in, I can form sentences like a shy 1.5-year-old Anything above 3 characters is probably grammatically incorrect, or you could say that... but a native speaker wouldn t. Different paradigm altogether. But a Chinese can pick up decent Japanese in less time. Ruby if you know Python is kind of learning another European language, if you already know one.Learning Haskell or Prolog is kind of learning Chinese if you only know imperative languages.

2018-05-26 10:02:24.000	Without metrics such as conversions which require end to end tracking advertisers will need to rely on the reputation of the platform. Products such as google and facebook will receive significant attention from advertisers.Yes that s a valid concern. But blogging hasn t been profitable or even sustainable for a very long time now in the way it used to be ten or fifteen years ago, with YouTube, Fb, microblogging platforms, and news aggregators having taken this space instead. Those who keep on running blogs do so for promoting their own services, products, or other agendas, or as a hobby, and will continue to do so. So it s not a terrible loss really the great starving of blogs has already happened in the past.But sites such as product review blogs could get a boost by ad money being in need to be allocated in innovative ways. Post-GDRP advertising requires thinking a little bit out of the box, and leaving the ad model as we know it behind which isn t very effective to begin with. If you consider attention a scarce resource to compete for, I could imagine ad money going into more and new native advertising sites, temporary sites for local events with direct sponsoring, focused sites for special interests, etc.

You insist on vaguely insulting me and ignoring me when I ask why they should be treated differently.They re both delivering packets from a datacenter in a specific spot to anywhere on the planet. They re charged based on different metrics, but it s easy to make a rough translation between those metrics.I ask if the numbers are wrong, you insult me.I ask why it s a false equivalence, you insult me.And you think I m the one not contributing to this conversation?
2023-11-12 15:04:28.000	Flipping the question around, what exactly are you worried they will do?I m on your side on this in that I dislike closed ecosystems, spyware and not having control over my own devices. But I am not in tech and the vast majority of people I know don t care about this and likely never will, and every year that goes by without Apple remotely bricking their phone with no recourse only strengthens their apathy.Trust doesn t have to be unqualified. You can accept that Apple s incentives don t align perfectly with yours while being comfortable that they align enough that Apple will provide you with the service you re looking for. The user controls the program or the program controls the user is a false dichotomy to people who spend most of their time in the real world.
2019-03-15 14:23:46.000	Look, this isn t mysterious. Rich people are associated with evil in films, and their stereotypical too-good pursuits -- mansions, opera halls, tuxedos, and yes, classical music.I don t think it s that simple. Rich people today are more modernists than classicists. They live in modern buildings and listen to any music. They work in modern office buildings.Classicism is about man vs man. Man vs nature, man vs God. The fight between two men, is a classic conflict. Modernism does not celebrate the fight between men, it cannot without undermining its fight with the self, it s fight with the non-existence of God.A fight between two men is classical in western literature, hence the classical themes when a fight on film breaks out.
2022-07-06 11:26:25.000	I tend to notice those eye floaters more as I get older. I find that white backgrounds on the screen make them a lot more noticeable, so I now use dark modes in some apps and have changed my desktop s background colour to a darker colour.
2018-02-11 10:05:43.000	FWIW, I skipped a couple grades but that didn t help me socialize with intellectual peers, it just hindered me from socializing with regular peers. The kind of socialization you re talking about didn t happen until college.Looking back now, what I d do with such a kid is acknowledge what they re good at, then get them working on things they re not so good at. Nobody s good at everything, and the experience of getting frustrated and getting through it is valuable.
2010-08-06 09:53:16.000	Funny how that works. I have had many many occasions of traveling while soaking wet for miles, and they always make great stories, and weren t all that bad.Now, on the other hand I ve had times where it s just downright miserable, and I was pretty sure my fingers were on the verge of serious frostbite, and that was NOT fun and never will be. But, that s not too common.

2009-12-14 00:31:46.000	To write anything beyond random characters, you have to think. The amount of thought can vary, indeed, depending on what you are writing. Even if you wrote the word dog --there are some units of thought concious or subconcious involved.On the other hand, we think without the physical act of writing all the time.

2022-06-27 10:32:15.000	Completely agree. Where CRDTs really shine is when you have a larger deviation of changes over time. They are brilliant for offline first type apps, and in fact are what Apple Notes use.Last year I experimented with combining Yjs with PouchDB CouchDB to achieve automatic conflict handling with a multi master type architecture and eventual consistency. It worked brilliantly!I think it s because there is just generally so much hype around real-time collaborative apps at the moment. But the reality is people spend much more time working async and merging changes later. I suppose what s particularly brilliant with CRDTs is that they handle both use cases very well, you don t have to have two different systems.

2022-07-08 02:37:15.000	For what it s worth, as someone who helped quarterback the SOC2 process, it s a place that s ripe for personal innovation. We had automated scripts do our quarterly screenshots, learned and made full use of AWS Config to check and enforce compliance, worked hard to automate patching, and started tracking all audit tasks using Jira Service Desk. It ended up we used about two engineer-days a quarter on audit tasks. There s no escaping the annual review, but if you spend some time to streamline yourself, it goes pretty smoothly we found.
2018-04-16 18:09:43.000	For my purposes? Very reliably. But my use cases are very sporadic I m just exposing a webhook for my VCS and running when one of a small set of my personal projects are updated. It also runs a couple other small things for the house.
2021-10-27 23:03:57.000	I think it is a smart way to handle it and it would work for some CEO founders however, some founders operate as board members that still influence much of the direction and operation without the same possibilities for pay rate increases to cover the gains. I think this could work under specific ownership scenarios but, for high p e ratio companies this will likely requires ownership sales.

NCMEC is an excellent org and such public-nonprofit partnerships help free up LE agencies to pursue arrests and prosecutions. The sheer volume of reporting would overwhelm most agencies. They ll wait until they have more concrete leads before getting involved.
2019-09-03 01:07:13.000	That s theoretically true, but wouldn t the fact that fasting is low-risk in healthy populations indicate that the risk is more likely to be low for populations with cancer?Also, from your example if you re one of the 100, then fasting is in fact advisable.I understand that purely for legal reasons we can t advise doctors to recommend fasting as a general guideline without gold-plated evidence. However it should be noted that just because the risk has not yet been perfectly quantified does not mean it is entirely unknown.For my part if I ever contract any sort of cancer, I will never reject a potential treatment on the grounds of well we know it s low-risk in healthy populations, and given what we know of the biology it seems like there s some potential effectiveness. But we don t have a gold-plated-chocolate-coated mass population double-blind study for your specific cancer yet, so I d advise against trying it .Taking minor, well-thought-out risks is the least one should do when fighting for one s life. It s a good thing doctors aren t financial advisors, or they d tell you to avoid the S P 500 index fund and stick to your 2 savings account.

2010-07-08 18:44:38.000	You might find the blog post linked below encouraging. It was written by a professor at UIUC. advice is think about what you really want to do, and why you want to do it. If you want to do good research then it makes sense to apply to highly ranked PhD programs because they will give you a support system to help you learn. If you just want to own a PhD from a specific school, then it will be harder to get in, harder to finish, and less meaningful when you re done.My advice for your specific goal is to somehow get involved with a professor s research. Preferably someone who will be recognized by admission committees. Their letter will help a lot. This might involve getting an MS at the highest-ranked school you can get admitted to. Sadly, those programs are not usually funded as opposed to American PhD programs .

2010-11-22 22:18:44.000	One thing which mystifies me about this whole situation is that Facebook arguably benefits from Lamebook s presence. Lamebook isn t a substitute for Facebook, it s a complement to Facebook. Someone who enjoys Lamebook for its humor will probably try extra-hard to find entertaining scenarios among their own Facebook friends, meaning that Lamebook increases Facebook s usage. Why you d want to shut down a company that gives you more traffic and therefore revenue for a relatively unimportant and legally dubious reason is beyond me.Not to mention, of course, the fact that Facebook is already invoking the Streisand effect by going after Lamebook at all.

2011-10-03 23:01:19.000	At least internally Rails 3 is a lot less crufty and hackish than Rails 2. If you ever tried writing your own plugins and such to deal with certain internals there is a lot to appreciate about Rails 3.From a general use perspective, Rails has always been designed with a focus on intuitiveness and trying to eschew unnecessary configuration. Whether it succeeds on both fronts is a matter of opinion, but considering the types of configuration options it provides I think the team has done a pretty good job.Rails is a pre-built web app architecture. Of course it is always going to be quicker and have less of a learning curve to just throw together your own simple app architecture from scratch. But if the app you re building isn t trivial, in most cases it s going to save you a lot of time in not reinventing the wheel or getting caught in common pitfalls to go with the prebuilt time-tested community-supported architecture.I wouldn t think Rails compares too poorly to the PHP MVC frameworks. Sure if you re building just a simple sort of website with maybe a few forms go with framework-free PHP, but for more complex but somewhat standard web apps if you forgo the framework for Ruby, PHP, etc. it is usually a mistake.

I think that s a more worthwhile effort than rewriting sqlite.

I understand that the legal system is very complex like a programming language with funky syntax , but there IS a process and there ARE standard ways to go about doing things, even if there are particularities for different locations. I suppose this is the kind of thing you learn in law school or from experience in a courtroom, but there is no reason that it can t be taught outside of those environments.Is there a repository for learning the basics and maybe more advanced legal processes? What forms to send to whom, and when, and what to be sure to do, and what to never do?It s learn-able if there is a resource that teaches it. An online Khan Academy-like resource. Or even maybe an educational game. The only lawyer sim I ve seen is Phoenix Wright.Sure, I d still prefer an experienced lawyer to do the driving if something comes up, but I d feel more confident with some solid legal knowledge of my own.

Looking through the bibliography here most of their computational citations are from 2011-2017, which confused me at first.I think the deal with this paper is not what, but how. In this work, a CRAM array based on magnetic tunnel junctions MTJs is experimentally demonstrated. First, basic memory operations as well as 2-, 3-, and 5-input logic operations are studied. Then, a 1-bit full adder with two different designs is demonstrated. Based on the experimental results, a suite of modeling has been developed to characterize the accuracy of CRAM computation. Further analysis of scalar addition, multiplication, and matrix multiplication shows promising results. So it s a funky kind of memory cell. Which they then... These results are then applied to a complete application a neural network based handwritten digit classifier, So we have again arrived at the point in the R D epicycle where every research paper is linked to the buzzword of the day to attract the very short attention spans of investors.

String diagrams is a small DSL while the above is intended to be more foundational and be used to bootstrap and translate between various specific diagrammatic theories including String diagrams . The study of each of these diagrammatic theories , each modelling a separate part of cognitive, physical, or mathematical reality, are currently separate. Our grand vision is to develop a fully integrated framework, in which all of the above can be comprehended and dealt with together. More deeply, this approach can also be applied to the study of diagrammatic theories themselves 12, 33 . As such, it is its own metatheory . One major goal of the project will be to understand to what extent this can serve as a foundation for mathematics itself, as a replacement for set theory.Also, as an ironic side note in relation with the article, some of the diagrammatic theories that have been elaborated by this group include diagrams that contain and not just represent matrices. I don t know why I m commenting in this thread, I don t understand anything in these papers, I just know it describes what I see, i.e. the great universal diagram. Don t you see it ?

2020-04-30 21:07:32.000	Hey -- very interesting that this article aggravates you. I d really like to know more about what resonated with you personally, even if that resonation was negative.You ve given me a lot to chew on, and I really appreciate the unbiased, perhaps even adversarial, response. The conclusion about the pricing model feels the most forced to me. What he s really saying is that he wanted to limit the number of customers to 25 or so and achieve a 2k MRR within 2 months.I think this is an incorrect assumption. The idea going in is if I can get to 2k MRR within two months, that ll free me up to quit my day job by extending my runway significantly. Then I can spend all my time working on the SaaS, working on the more time-consuming parts like marketing, organic content generation and outreach, etc. Reading the article, what really seems to have happened is that he spent a week creating a UI POC, shopped it to 30 BI folks on LinkedIn over two weeks, and didn t get traction. I m not sure what happened to the 20-30 reach outs per day.Well, I had started doing those 20-30 reach outs per day, but on like day two I found Jason s video and it blew my mind enough to disrupt me from that course of action immediately. I stopped doing outreach to think about it why would I want to bother people about something I may not even ship? .After spending some time thinking about it and discussing whether or not I should continue with a couple of my mentors and my dad, we all agreed that my time could be better spent elsewhere. The real reason for the failure wasn t the pricing model, it was that the developer wanted something that would earn 2k month with little to no effort on his part.I hesitate to call this failure anymore after reading the other comments on this post, which have been really helpful in shaping how I think about this whole story.Instead, it s a thought-through decision to put my effort in elsewhere.If I can spend the same amount of time building a POC and getting 25 paying users, with all else being equal, why would I want to spend that time building a POC for which I can charge less? Isn t it natural to build a startup where I can charge more, if that s within the realm of possibility?Given the fact that I was only three weeks in, I wasn t suffering from sunk cost fallacy of well, I ve come this far -- might as well keep going now! . The pricing model comes in when he decides what of customers he can support in whatever amount of time he was willing the spend. He then extrapolated a number from that to get 2k MRR.Actually, the 2k MRR comes from picking a somewhat arbitrary goal that I thought was slightly out of reach, and significant enough. I think there were a couple of people that mentioned hitting 2k MRR within 6 - 12 months in Indie Hacker podcasts, so I thought -- if they can do it that fast, is there any reason I can t do it faster?My thinking here comes from that quote Tim Ferriss likes to share, why not six months instead of ten years? So... why not give it a shot, ya know? Then, and only then, did he actually look at what comparable products on the market charge.Actually, those numbers came up in conversations I was having with the people I reached out to on LinkedIn.They started talking about price, and I watched Jason s video, at around the same time.The reason I didn t mention anything about price in my first article was simply because I legit hadn t even thought of it at all.Once I did think of it -- well, I ll end with asking this rhetorical question again if I could build something and sell it to 25 people for either X or 2X, why would I build something I can only sell for X? It makes sense to go for the 2X, right?Cheers, and thanks again for taking the time to write up that comment. It s been helpful to me in thinking about how I went about this and what I will do differently next time. The more I think about it, I m pretty sure the whole exercise, including the pricing model conclusion, was simply an exercise in content generation. If so, well played, sir.Welllllll... about that. The articles I ve been writing about this process are definitely an exercise in content generation. The process itself, though, is just me fumbling my way through this with few mentors and little experience.

2024-06-18 06:18:15.000	I ve no such ability and never claimed to , but I ll share what I can.A few years ago I was standing on my balcony. I saw a lizard sunning itself on a rock, a story below. On impulse I made a shadow puppet of a bird, and that lizard took off running. I don t know what the emotional experience of a lizard is like, but I m as certain as I am of anything that the lizard feared for it s life, whatever fear means to a lizard. Maybe fear isn t an emotion to a lizard, maybe it s more like a state of mind. I have no idea, that question is unanswerable.I ve had mouse problems many times. I can tell you that mice have distinct personalities. I catch them with live traps and release them. Some of them leave immediately when the box opens. Others cower and must be coaxed out. They have favored places and such. If you study then and learn their habits, you can place traps very effectively.There was a mouse that would go behind my toaster and chew on stuff. The first time I walked over to see what the sound was, they threw themselves off the counter and tumbled down the spice rack. The second time they darted out and climbed down the spice rack. The third time, they came out at a relaxed pace, easy as can be, and gracefully climbed the power chord down to the floor. Presumably they learned I was all bark and no bite.

2012-06-14 19:21:55.000	I absolutely love the mail client in Opera. In fact, it s the primary reason I still use Opera as my main browser. At work I use Chrome because we use our own webmail client same one we sell to customers .I have six email accounts setup in my Opera, all using IMAP. There s a unified INBOX so I can check all my messages, but still be able to review each INBOX separately. Email search is BLAZING fast, the fastest search I have ever used, though it lacks advanced search options like searching only in the subject.The contacts view is also awesome. Click on a contact and it ll show all the mail to and from that person, instantly. No searching.The best part is that I never have to check my email. Opera notifies me as soon as I get an email thanks to IMAP and I keep open the sidebar on the right so I can always see the UNREAD counter to know if I have new messages or not.Since reading email and browsing the web are things I do all the time, it really makes a lot of sense to me to have those two activities live in the same window and use the same tab navigation system. I love it.

Swift will get there very soon, I m sure.Admittedly I m basing my opinion on Swift as it was about 12 months ago so hopefully someone can tell me how wrong I am and that the frequent IDE crashes and compiler bugs are fixed, refactoring is now available, autocomplete works really well, compile times have improved, and the language has no more breaking changes, etc.It s just that I have work to do and Objective C is still solid and dependable. Playing with Swift was fun but I kept running into too many yak-shaving diversions to get even basic things done.So is it time for me to switch?

By this rhetoric there isnt any deep art, whatsoever, in existence. And I think that bolsters the point that we need less escapism and that actual real critical thought needs to be applied.

2020-04-06 20:51:44.000	In the background global warming is a much greater threat to human life and has the exact same dynamic with the exact same playersOh, please, enough already!Global warming is nowhere near to what a virus can do. This thing could have killed half the population of this planet in weeks had nobody done a thing about it.The comparison is nonsensical on many fronts. Perhaps the most significant of them is the reality of climate change We cannot do a thing about it. Period. We cannot change it. We cannot reverse it. We cannot magically fix it in fifty years.This is already well understand by the scientific community. Researchers don t get out there and expose it because they would instantly destroy their careers, lose grants and generally ruin their lives. It s a truly dishonest and damaging feedback loop driven by ideology, money and politics.All you need to do in order to understand this reality is analyze ice core atmospheric sample data. That s it. It s that simple. Calculate the rate of change with CO2 increasing and decreasing. Write down those numbers.Then realize this is what would happen if humanity left earth next Monday. It would take somewhere around 50,000 years for CO2 to decrease by 100 ppm.We cannot accelerate this rate of change by 1000x without likely killing all life on earth. We can t. It would require such vast amounts of energy and resources that it might even be beyond what s available on this planet.In other words, everyone is lying Climate change deniers are nuts and those who claim we can fix it within even a few generations and just as crazy. The entire thing has become politicized beyond all comprehension. Science has left the building.So, no. Let s focus on pandemics, they are far more likely to wipe us out than the entire save the planet fantasy.

Algorithm courses dont teach Coppersmith-Winograd unless you are in some very special course that is designed for those few people who want exactly that out of interest and curiosity. Agree completely, but it s important not to oversell the theory.The thread is about whether it was shocking for algo prof to not know C few dozen years ago. It is not, regardless of how useful C and architecture is.

As I mentioned it is possible to misinterpret. What I am saying is this is knowable. I can understand how you took this from what I said, and I ll try to express myself more clearly in the future, but allow me to highlight part of my comment I t may not be possible to describe, it may not be infallible, but it is real.Something to consider is that your criticism works both ways. If Fred feels that Bob is bullying him, and Bob feels he is offering tough love and not bullying Fred, by your logic we can t dismiss Fred s assertion.

That s why much poorer Vietnam doesn t have visa free travel to JP or SK despite having extremely permissive FTAs with both countries. without VISA there d be more low income travellers from PRC, but that s something airline supply demand will filter outOr, you know, visa free status and overstay rates by country. Eitherway, housing price makes some sense, but this data still feels off, considering PRC is at 65 urbanization vs Thai 50 , and neither urban nor rural thai measures up to urban or rural PRC from my travels.Well, firstly, Chinese urbanization rates seem to be miscounted upwards, as Tsinghua noted 1 for 2019 and earlier data. The Chinese numbers are closer to 50-55 .Secondly, rural and urban incomes are starkly different in Thailand versus China, as both countries government released statistics have shown, and even Thailand s National and Local HDI statistics have proven.There s no way around it, the average Thai who lives a rural or semi-rural life has a better quality of life than the average Chinese person who also lives a rural or semi-rural life 0 - -

2021-02-13 17:06:22.000	They were easily persuaded by weird, contrarian things, said Robin Hanson, a professor of economics at George Mason University who helped create the blogs that spawned the Rationalist movement. Because they decided they were more rational than other people, they trusted their own internal judgment. The article as a whole is meh, but that quote made skimming it worthwhile.I ve never been impressed by the rationalist community around SSC, LessWrong, Overcoming Bias, etc., but I ve really struggled to put my finger on it. This gets pretty damn close.The whole sphere struck me from the beginning way before present controversies as a big circle jerk of smart people trying to impress each other. The standard issue rationalist flex is to pick a contrarian point of view and invent an extremely novel argument for it. Bonus points if it skirts close to something controversial or taboo, but doesn t quite cross the line. Then an endless thread of discussion can ensue where all the participants have an opportunity to flex by either agreeing or taking apart the argument.Problem is I never got the sense that anything was being accomplished, nor that the ideas coming out of these places stood up when dragged out of their bubbles and examined in the context of the wider world and the wider sphere of human experience.The first thing that really put me off was the whole idea of runaway super-intelligent AI. Please, please, please for the love of g-d study some biology. Dunning-Krueger is a worn out meme but I think the idea of it applies well to CS people talking about intelligence as opposed to glorified statistical regression without knowing anything about biology, which is the only existing example of an intelligent system.The neo-racist human biodiversity and neoreactionary stuff just put me off further. When it emerged it didn t surprise me one bit that it came from those circles. Contrarian? Check. Controversial? Check. Elitist? Check.In the end I started thinking of it as an online cult, sort of a really high-brow companion to the chans. I guess the hierarchy goes rationalist sphere chan culture Qanon.

2017-07-13 19:50:18.000	You can, but from my understanding the math is not equivalent - employer-subsidised healthcare is cheaper even when you factor everything in, because they benefit from group-buying discounts.Well, that s partially correct. True for General Electric, but companies with 500-1,000 employees don t really have a pull. Remember that insurance is also bought by state, so only employers heavily concentrated in one state get those.The biggie on the employer side is tax deductibility. US taxpayers generously subsidize the cost of employer-purchased health plans but not the cost of individual-purchased health plans.As an individual you can tweak the situation in your favor figure out if your doctor or dentist belongs to an HMO, join an HMO instead of PPO EPO plan, buy a bronze plan when you re young and single, upgrade to gold or platinum when you re older or have kids , but the massive corporate subsidy still means that someone working for a corporation and receiving exact same benefit would be paying less.
2020-01-16 21:56:53.000	Others have already commented, but normal surveillance radar is like a spotlight from the tower. It goes around and scans the area. If they determine that you are important, the radar can lock on to you which means that it will no longer scan around but would shine the light on you constantly.If they want to shoot at you, they turn on another even stronger more focused light to improve accuracy.Military today have ability to detect enemy targetting radars and when they lock on so having such a thing in SciFi does not seem strange to me.

But a bigger issue is that A LOT of people are looking for short term gains. Just look at crypto, even the most serious nonscammy people in the space believe it will take many years to reach it s true potential, but if you look that the message boards and twitter, they are full of people talking about daily monthly or even hourly gains.These people don t actually care if PLTR hits 500B in revenue in 2035, they just want their stock price to go up 10x this year.

It takes time to build up the leg strength it takes to bike well enough for commuting, most people don t have the time to train for weeks so that they can comfortably conquer the hill on the way to work or whatever.More bikes on the road means more pressure on drivers to keep an eye out, and more pressure on politicians to make infrastructure safe for cyclists.

2023-07-26 18:00:23.000	SDXL is in roughly the same ballpark as MJ 5 quality-wise, but the main value is in the array of tooling immediately available for it, and the license. You can fine-tune it on your own pictures, use higher order input not just text , and daisy-chain various non-imagegen models and algorithms object feature segmentation, depth detection, processing, subject control etc to produce complex images, either procedural or one-off.

2017-03-05 20:03:59.000	I m a professional developer, I don t want a new toy language.First, there s nothing toy about Swift. It s a full featured language on par with Rust, Go, etc.Second, whether some random web dev or embedded C dev or Java dev wants Swift or not is irrelevant to its intended audience and utility. It s not for professional developers in general, it s for Mac iOS application developers, and thus, for Mac iOS users that benefit as a side-effect from developers having a modern better language to implement stuff . I m buying a powerful laptop, I don t want cloud storage.So? Millions of users do want it, judging from the huge popularity of Dropbox, Google Drive, MS implementation of the same, etc. I want the possibility to dual boot or share drives with other operating systems, I don t need a new proprietary filesystem.Again, irrelevant. Lots of Mac users, and tons of pundits HAVE asked for a new proprietary filesystem to replace HFS and Apple obliged.And whether you can dual boot or share drives is orthogonal to whatever OS X has a new native filesystem. You can still format the rest of the hard disk on another fs to dual boot, and you can still share drives with other systems in NTFS, xFAT, etc. I don t want compressed memory, I want 32GB of RAM.And I want a pony unicorn. But until Intel delivers boards that accept 32GB low-power RAM of the kind that goes into Apple laptops, we re not gonna get it. And Intel gives late 2017 early 2018 as the date for those. Existing PC laptops with 32 GB ram merely sacrifice battery life using regular high power drawing RAM -- and even those are far and few between . And of course compressed memory helps whether you have 16 or eventually 32GB of ram In short, Apple is spending a lot of effort making features that I, as a professional developer and 20 year Mac user, don t want.Well, as a 15 year Mac user and 20 years professional developer, I do want those things.I don t particularly care for the touch strip though -- I d prefer it to be OLED physical buttons giving both tactile feel AND changeable inscriptions.

As someone who mispronounces lot of words because of my education in Indian English which takes most of the sounds from British English, this is very helpful. Though there are google and merriam websters dictionary, sometimes it is not easy to get the pronunciation in a sentence. This fills that gap! I m also curious know how it is implemented. Thanks all the best!

When my girlfriend s fridge started making loud noises and running constantly, she complained to the landlord who had it fixed enough so it was quieter, but it still ran constantly, running up her electricity bill.

2023-01-31 20:38:10.000	What is making people want to restrict their neighborhood to extremely low density suburbs? The answers are very uncomfortable.That s just urbanists smearing people with innuendo about racism to advance unrelated policy goals. It s actually ironic, because one of the major population trends right now is black flight to the suburbs.People, especially families, like low density suburban zoning because it s convenient. I live in a pre-zoning code suburb with houses packed tightly together. People are always fighting over parking spots, contractor trucks can block people into their parking spots or block the road, etc. There s a lot of retired people, and they complain about families with young kids moving in due to the noise. And these are white and white adjacent kids too. My parents refused to move into the subdivision, and instead moved nearby to a 1 acre plot surrounded by trees where they didn t have to interact with their neighbors.
2014-07-03 19:43:40.000	It looks like the 20 is 20 of the value that year, so it looks like value is shown with exponential decay.So if a car starts out at 20,000 it will be worth 16,000 the next year, 12,800 after the second year, and 10,240 after the third. Notice that around the third year, the decrease in value slows considerably.

2023-09-23 19:02:31.000	we shouldn t get rid of something until we have some idea of why it was put there to start withRight, Chesterton s Fence doesn t mean we shouldn t change, but that we should understand before doing so. And we do understand, which is why there s a push for change. I suggest you do your own researchI did, I know. I also know that these things could be back again, and soon. so precious and fickle, all of it was hard fought and won over generations When you grow up, you tend to get told that the world is the way it is, your life is just to live your life inside the world, try not to bash into the walls too much, try to have a nice family, have fun, save a little money.That s a very limited life. Life can be much broader, once you discover one simple fact, and that is that everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you. And you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use. Once you learn that, you ll never be the same again. the ideas you and your kin share will bring about the end of modern civilisation as we know itWe re already over the edge, and instead of trying to slow down our fall, we re accelerating even faster. inequality, poverty, racism, xenophobia.. When in reality these are crucial underpinnings of civilisationThese aren t necessary components for a society to thrive and progress. It s crucial to differentiate between describing what has often occurred in history and prescribing what ought to be or what is ethically right for the future. You guys don t just want to make incremental change, you want root control over the system The biggest perpetuator of systemic poverty and inequality is collectivism. Its inflation. Its embedded growth obligations. Its byzantine regulations. I suggest you look into the Cantillon effect, IMF World Bank Expolitation by Alex Gladstein etc.Do you really believe these kinds of problems can be solved by incremental change?
2023-03-07 11:05:13.000	Hello,At my current gig we re using doppler 1 no affiliation for application secrets. We re using doppler with their kubernetes operator which supports auto-rotation on secrets. Secrets are set as env variables . So far, doppler has not suffer big outages or we did not notice, because the operator will keep working even if their API is down - of course you won t get updates. Access control could be more _fine grained_ and they added secret auto-rotation option recently 2 . We don t use that yet.I ve been a happy 1Password user no affiliation and we use it company wide to share user secrets. 1Password support CI CD integration IIRC, so in theory should cover most use cases.If you can pay for AWS Vault, the terraform integration comes out of the box. However if you re a small team running vault might be a daunting task and you re inserting another SPoF.There are many open source application secrets tools that you could check out though. In the past I had great experience with credstash 3 . Credstash is a really simple and secure open source solution that is based on AWS KMS, IAM and DynamoDB. Costs pennies to run for medium size deployments. Once you setup and document the way to use it, it s really easy. The downside is that as a tool is pretty _raw_ you have to build things like secret generators , etc. But combined with a slack bot can be a really powerful, secure, cost-effective self-hosted solution that doesn t require maintenance as opposed to solutions like Vault .If you have specific questions about any of the above tools feel free to drop an email. I ll happy to answer questions. 1 Auto-rotation is complicated because you need to integrate the auto-rotation with external tools yourself most of the times. There are Hashi-Vault modules for SQL DBs but not for Mailgun or CloudFlare for example. 3

2021-11-24 02:56:03.000	Here is a great article to read on why layer1 blockchain scalability isn t sustainable long-term for any layer 1 reading about competing blockchains, it s important to figure out if someone you re reading values money or decentralization and therefore individual s digital autonomy once we enter the Metaverse . Polynya Liberosist on Reddit is in the same camp as me - we want the most permissionless, secure, and censorship resistant solution. As an Ethereum Dev recently put it they want to build in the MSIT secure, decentralized blockchain and as long as Ethereum is the only one providing that, they ll keep building on Ethereum.It s hard to understand which protocols are the most decentralized and secure because blockchains have gone from being built for decentralization, to being marketing machines. No one really writes about things like the importance of state receipts for blockchain validation, how many chains remove those due to the storage overhead, and how users lose a lot of self-reliance when that happens. I think they largely don t write about it because most users nowadays just want to get rich and don t care about decentralization, but I hope that changes and people realize that we need a neutral layer to store digital assets that we actually own as the Metaverse becomes a real part of our lives over the next 10-20 years.

If you don t need all that performance then there are other laptops not Apple that can last long enough between charging too. M1 Mac is currently an excellent laptop for regular users but real power users either have to be close to the wall or use desktop CPUs to run their workloads...and no, web and software development does not require a lot of CPU power, I know, I am a developer and I develop software for people who do need to run 100 CPU for hours and hours and M1 laptop will not last them any longer than the i7.

2024-06-04 07:46:53.000	If you want something on the more application side, I.e. utilization of low-level techniques, I can highly recommend looking into game engine development, even if you aren t interested in games per say.I ve recently enjoyed Game Engine Architecture, mostly because there is an interesting mix using low level techniques to solve problems a normal application wouldn t be required to fix.Game development in general is case for tuning yourself to when you should utilize high level programming techniques, and when required dropping into low level optimization to solve local problems.

Those architects aren t supervising construction at all.But, if you ve hired the architect to supervise construction, you ve still got to supervise the architect. Maybe you only have to hound the architect to get issues fixed and let them figure out who fixes it, though and they ll likely get a lot of things fixed without you, but you ll still get better results with regular supervision than hands off.

Basically they are trying to train models for scoring literatures based on their quality, novelty and what not. At the current rate and state of AI, I cannot ever imagine this is going to work.It was a few weeks ago that someone shared The Dark Age of AI on HN 1 . I think we are promising way over what Drew McDermott thought we would not going to promise. This is to the extend that we are applying AI on assessing Art, Creativity and even quality and novelty of Science, something that in a way we don t even understand or trying to understand ourselves at the time that we are publishing it. 1
2014-01-30 16:07:16.000	For those who are curious why CPS is such a great compiler representation for implementing optimizations, it s because the passes require less analysis complexity. You only have to handle the call portion and don t have to worry separately about return points though you ve really just converted returns into a call to a new function! .It sounds trivial, but in practice it dramatically reduces the size of not only optimization passes such as inlining, but it makes analyses that drive optimizations simpler as well e.g., control-flow analysis . For an example from my experience Manticore - my pretty coarse CFA analysis on our direct-style IR is about 750 lines of SML code whereas an optimized CFA with three different variants and extra support for environment analysis is only 700 lines of SML.

2022-11-12 11:23:49.000	From my limited experience in Big Tech, these kinds of companies are pretty good at running data centers from the hardware, networking, and low-level OS management perspectives. But their server-side programming backend engineering suffers from a lot of the same problems as their mobile app development. In fact, it s frequently way worse because you can t say anything like what if someone wants to download our app over a 3G data connection to get people to cut down on bloat.Overstaffing and ship-the-org-chart syndrome leads to ginormous app bundles on the client and 7000 microservices on the server.
2022-01-26 19:40:03.000	Advertising corrupts. Ad-tech corrupts absolutely.The reason is the cumulative impact of two things 1. Algorithmic optimization of results for ad click-through rates, and2. The scarcity of space for organic results on results pages for queries with commercial intent because of the large amount of space given to ads . The high value of the clicks on those pages sometimes 100 drives marketers to focus disproportionate resources on SEO tricks and gaming to show in one of the few spaces left on the front page.A search engine with ads and ad-tech tracking cannot work well for consumers in the long term. Google is now an ad-tech company, not a search company. It employs 3x as many people on advertising as search. Edit for clarity It makes sense in this context to programmatically re-write titles to optimize conversion, rather than consumer experience.

What they don t see is that the work done by competent engineers doesn t blow up and become a visible crisis.IMO this is a big red flag that something is wrong with both the technical and non-technical culture. Technical management isn t happening, at least not effectively, and non-technical management is getting too far into the weeds on technical details of production issues.

2021-02-28 22:51:59.000	Here s another paradox worth thinking about when trying to have incentive-only regulations carrots without sticks. You might think that higher rates would incent companies to weatherize, but actually they perversely might reduce incentives... if you owned 100 power plants, of which some will work in an emergency and some won t, all you need is for the fraction that are weatherized to get enough surplus revenues during peak times to cover for the plants that are offline so that your overall revenues are flat or slightly higher. Higher electricity rates actually reduce your need to weatherize your plants.

TAB in IPython and look at its methods.For example, in Sympy, you have a matrix type called Matrix. You can do A B .diagonalize , or alternatively you can do Matrix.diagonalize A B , which has some advantages because doing A B . TAB does nothing useful because Python can t infer types.You can also do the same for modules. ModuleName. TAB To be honest though, I found the experience smoother in R for some reason.

2016-03-31 16:42:26.000	As a CRO consultant this is interesting, but I m skeptical. It s not particularly your fault. Nearly every marketing tool promises nirvana, but very few of them deliver. It sounded great until I realized that 1 I would still have to think of variations and create them myself.2 Even after that, this would only be useful if things like location and time of day really did have a significant effect on conversion rates.3 And even after that, this would only be _worth it_ if those effects were not obvious to me and could only be discovered with ML. For instance, it doesn t take ML to hypothesis that a visitor who came from an ad link utm_campaign dogs is more interested in seeing a page about Dogs. And that hypothesis can be tested for free with Optimizely.In other words, ML is cool and all but I don t see what value this adds to conversion optimization.Maybe my assumptions are wrong and I m missing something, in which case I hope this is useful feedback.

Sure you probably don t want to do it for idk. openssl, or your web framework. But reviewing, pinning and forgetting about small self contained dependencies as long you don t run into bugs can be a pretty good idea through depends a lot on the language, immutability of dependencies, etc. .Edit Also making it easy to change code when requirements change doesn t mean adding all kinds of generic abstractions to your code. It mean keeping code clean and simple and avoiding implicit logic dependencies enough to make code changes easy. Adding a lot of generic abstractions can make it harder to change things instead of easier.

2021-07-28 15:29:06.000	I have a fun trivia fact to share actually - here in UK, it s one of the only remaining places in the world where you can still legally buy leaded petrol for automotive use. Only a handful of garages around the country are certified to sell it, the prices are very high, but it s the ultimate fuel for people who want to preserve their old vehicles in original factory state, without modifying anything to run on unleaded fuel. Alternatively, the sale of leaded additive is still allowed which literally just contains TEL - tetraethyl lead - effectively turning 95 unleaded into the old 4-star leaded .This website used to list the garages still selling leaded petrol, but they have changed the whole site very recently - so you can only see the list on wayback machine additive

You can t point me to one other industry where you can start selling shit w o knowing what you re doing . Or if you can t sell your things you lure people in with free stuff and sneakily fuck them up w o no laws to work around which protect them.Simply and brutally put if you are incompetent and or malevolent in your business practices and for that reason your business faces existencial threat from a piece of regulation that codifies the ideal setting for the industry, your business better dies ASAP.I want that just like you can t have a random person design cars, architect buildings or teach our kids, similarly a random person cannot code up a commercial government web site where they were learning as I went along and an enterprise that can t afford to consult a lawyer can not get their hands on people s private data that they d rather not change throughout their lives. Entrepreneurs to the hell, the amount of irresponsibility some people posting here want conceded to them is mind-boggling. I really hope that the upcoming decade will bring some sanity to this wild-west of an industry where who don t know what they are fucking doing can t just go out and handle stuff that they should not be allowed to even observe with a telescope from miles and miles away.

2023-08-18 19:06:01.000	I appreciate you calling this out! In my community we started talking about it as Ask vs Attune culture. On the one hand do you assume everyone will be explicit with their wants, needs, and boundaries? On the other, do you pay attention to who you re engaging with, their general disposition, their communication style preferences, etc?I personally like to keep a balance between the two extremes and try to adapt my behavior to who I m engaging with you can tell I m comfortable in an Attune culture environment, but I appreciate when people are up front and communicative about their needs, wants, and boundaries . Considering the power differentials at play and the ability for someone to enforce their true boundaries is really important to me, and also having meta conversations to encourage folks to speak up about their needs and boundaries.In a work context, I will have a meta conversation with someone about their preferred communication style, how they want to receive feedback, how they want to be checked in with, etc. to avoid mismatched communication expectations.

The biggest myth in startups is that you have to live and breathe them to make them work. That s bullshit. Lots of people live and breathe stupid companies that come to nothing, and lots of people do a disciplined 9-5 that gets more done in 8 hours than the founder who lives at his desk gets done in a week.It helps not to look at it as a game. Matasano is a business, growing steadily, with a serious team and serious management. It isn t something that might pivot after some networking meetup thingy tomorrow, or if Facebook buys the wrong company next week.I d read a lot of patio11 if you re interested in this stuff too.
2019-12-14 02:04:41.000	Also consider viabale options for Plan B on the job training worked well for us even before Edition 2018 landed.We had a senior level Java developer learn Rust on the job and be very productive within a couple of weeks. I joined shortly after and was experience with Rust. This former Java dev and I shared knowledge equally I learned the Diesel ORM and our PostgreSQL integration from him with a few short conversations, and I perhaps helped abbreviate his remaining Rust learning curve with maybe three 1-2 minute conversations.Another person at that same company was primarily a React developer, and he picked up Rust in fairly short order as well, but I had less involvement there.A third person was fresh out of an extended bootcamp-style co-op program, and knew Java and React React-Native, but this her first position after graduating. Note that she came from a non-programming background prior goods trading industry. Also English is her third or fourth language. I walked her through potentially tricky bits of syntax and semantics such as descructuring-bind for Structs in an afternoon. Edition 2018 had long-since landed by her arrival, so that helped.Modifying existing Rust code and following the patterns worked well. She started small but progressed quickly. Within a few short months, she was adding back-end API endpoints actix-web pre-1.0 for her front-end needs, and she was creating new .rs files with most PRs merged as-is.

2023-06-01 14:44:47.000	Multi-ton vehicles capable of moving at highway speeds are dangerous and kill roughly a hundred people a day in the US 1 . So whether these changes are driven by regulatory capture or not it makes perfect sense to tightly regulate automobiles. Personally I think consumers should be free to decide things like seatbelt and airbag use but if they drive on public roadways they should not be allowed to make cost benefit tradeoffs that decrease the safety of those around them. small, cheap, runabout electric vehicles could become very popularAgreed that s a promising area. It s possible that the increasing regulatory burden on cars may drive an increase in low-speed vehicles such as neighborhood electric vehicles NEV for use cases that do not require more than 25mph 40kph. 2 Since they are exempt from the vast majority of new automobile regulations that makes them comparatively much simpler and more affordable. 1 I am not claiming this works for every suburban commute, just that there exists a nontrivial number of car trips in cities and towns that would be feasible in a NEV.

2021-03-01 02:42:21.000	I think fundamentally ICE vehicles have lots more choice right now. Tesla only competes in a few small segments.At the price points they are competing in, Tesla has a competitive price offering particularly if you are looking for performance . But there is a huge price umbrella below the base M3.I m not sure other EVs can say the same. The Bolt is in this weird territory where it s well priced for an EV, but it s not particularly well priced otherwise. Likewise the Nissan Leaf. I haven t seen or dealt with the VW.It is very shrewd of Tesla to stick to price points where they can compete effectively. Focusing on places where they can sell vehicles which are competitive on merits allows them to sell vehicles as quickly as they produce them.
2017-12-08 06:55:05.000	This seems to be all about tabs or windows.Am I the only one who uses tabs and windows?I have one browser window always open with all my everyday communications Gmail, Google Voice, Calendar, a corporate Outlook webmail account, a Discord team, etc.Then if I do something different I open a new window for it. If it s an HN break, I open a new window for the HN home page and start middle-clicking or Ctrl Cmd clicking each of the discussion and site links that look interesting. Now I have a window loaded up with those tabs that I can either look at or come back to later.Time to do a Google search on a particular topic? New window for the search, then middle-click the most promising results. Now I have a window grouping the research on that topic.So I end up with a number of windows for different activities or topics. Each of those windows has several tabs that relate to that specific interest.I have one friend who opens everything in a single window with dozens of tabs and no organization to them. I tried to demonstrate this system of a window per topic with fewer tabs in each window, but it just didn t register.It seems so easy though New topic? Ctrl N for a new window about that topic. Then open tabs within that window just for that topic.And when I m done with a topic, I can close all the tabs related to that topic in one fell swoop.I admit this is a very naive question, but it seems like such a practical and obvious approach - so why doesn t everyone do this?

2021-11-01 13:46:45.000	In the 90s, if you used ClarisWorks or WordPerfect or whatever, it was no big deal. You weren t collaborating over the Internet, you were submitting printed essays to your teachers, and group essays weren t really a thing. Heck, a good chunk of kids were still exclusively submitting handwritten homework, because only wealthier families had computers at home, and free access to computers was only during study hall, and even then there weren t enough for everyone.In the 2010s, when I was in grad school, the use of GSuite was absolutely obligatory. Professors shared course materials through Google Drive. They expected you to submit your homework the same way. And, in between, on group projects, all the actual work was done in Google Docs because that was how you collaborated - simultaneous editing.
2012-10-06 23:30:12.000	1. Really the question I should ve asked here was for example where their strong features got watered down. I m less interested in the specifics, but as far as I can tell, the webapp has gotten better over time, not worse. As for the circles thing, are you talking about seeing the contents of the circle themselves, or the posts shared with you by the people in that circle? If the first, on the left hand side there s a button for circles. If the second, on the home page at the top is your list of circles, just click on the one you want to see. So I guess I m not really seeing what you re complaining about.2. Are you using one of their free products or paid? If you re using Google Apps for Businesses, for example, there are support phone numbers to call.3. That s too bad then. The Android app certainly has problems, but overall is pretty good.

People don t stay at a company for 30 years and get a pension anymore. median number of years that employees have worked for their current employer is currently 4.1 years, according to an Economic News Release from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Certainly internal transfers have some advantages over external candidates, but I think most of those are shared by contractors who have been working internally.I m all for protecting workers, including contractors, but given the nature of modern business I m not convinced the company is the right mechanism for that.Also, keep in mind the average age of a company was 61 years, now it s 18.

But hell, if I sound like a propaganda apparatchik I could probably get a job at the Economist, huh?Re the substance of your post. the Chinese are mostly neutral business peopleThis is naive. They remember what was done to them in the opium war, and there is a reason they manufacture the stuff. the same dirtbags When one person falls into folly, that person is a fool. When an entire society falls into folly, can you blame each man as a fool? We have an opium problem. It was fueled by large pharamceutical companies, but in 2022 there is also a geopolitical component.Re RussiaI have no doubt Russia would like to see America knocked on its rear. However my biggest qualm with the support of Ukraine is not Russia right, America wrong, but that this is a self-own. What we ve done is force the world to make a decision, in which neutrality, once a holding pattern for the sake of good business, is now a knife s edge slicing through one s slipper. Moreover, the so-called smartest people in the room, by confiscating a substantial portion of Russia s sovereign wealth fund, have forced a realignment in which a great portion of the world is now trading oil in terms of rubles instead of dollars, which removes the base from under our own currency. I m sorry, our involvement in Ukraine was an overextension, and our measures in support of it were foolish and self-destructive. If I sound sympathetic to Russia, it is because I am frustrated with America and how this country is being run. The people who knew how to handle situations like this, such as the now oft-mention John Mearsheimer were ignored, in favor of weak-minded flag-wavers with complementary Lockheed caps in their closet.

For example next major version 6.0 will have the same features as 5.4 version with removed BC layer deprecations etc. . This allows for smoother upgrades. You just fix all deprecations and then You can upgrade major version without stress

It s my favourite type of sweet but it s quite hard to find in the UK not that I go to great lengths to find such things .I find it funny that in British English we would call such a thing a sweet even though it s not actually very sweet which is why I like it . Sweet is roughly equivalent to candy in American English, but with a notable exception chocolate is not considered a sweet but falls instead into the broader category of confectionery.

While it s a virtue for Silicon Valley organizations like YC to adapt quickly, adapting in this case means clearing the way for the administration to solidify its haphazard immigration policy.

DeepL has very very sensible defaults and the UI is great. But in fairness, DeepL basically will never just insert an appropriate idiom. Also GPT-3.5 is still worth comparing to DeepL as well.

Every other fast food place around here is just as cheap or cheaper, and very few are as low quality and inconsistent.It is hard to consider McDonald s the cheap option when a big mac and fries is 8, but a gyro and fries that taste way better, and are 30 more food is 5 at the place across the street. McDonald s is actually the second most expensive fast food option I ve found, only being cheaper than Mucho Burrito which is far better food .

2010-07-09 15:47:07.000	Someone asked me if I am losing sleep over the ethics of the situation. I think there are two separate issues Ethically. I m ok. This is because a mortgage has pre-arranged clauses in the contract that outline what the exit criteria are for the bank and the borrower. It s a contract with a pre-negotiated process around a divorce. A prenuptual if you will. In this case, we are just choosing to execute one of the clauses in the contract, as any business has the right to do. So, there is nothing unethical about adhering to the contract.Morally. There are concerns about short sales and foreclosures bringing down property values in the neighborhood. And that is an overall market affect. And there is a concern that this action brings down the overall market. It s the same as what happens when the stock market has a sell off - every time a stock is sold in repeating fashion, the overall value of the market declines as there is more cash on the side. Morally, I am personally ok, because the expectation with me and my fellow neighborhood residents was that we were all seeking asset appreciation, and when that didn t occur, there was an understanding that we may all have to pursue options to rectify the situation. I was open with my peer group about that 5 years ago when first buying the property. If I had lied about my intentions, it would be a different story.Also, and I forgot to mention this. In both of our cases, we have changed our job situation such that it is not profitable on a monthly basis to continue paying our mortage and there is no refinancing situation that makes it profitable. And we both explored conversion to rentals. We d be in a situation where monthly, we were expending nearly 3K month in losses if they were both rentals.

2013-04-12 21:58:25.000	Put some numbers on it! It will look sciencey!Math does not work when applied to the data.Most of the volume is from 60000 barrels stolen from pipelines people drilling holes in the pipes and catching in buckets , undoubtedly some portion spilled. That is almost 3,000,000 gallons. The rest of the data is lost in the fudge factor that brings that down. Two of the spill events are from about 10 gallons each, probably should list every car accident that splits a gas tank. 1.2 million gallons sounds like a lot. In the US we ve recently added vapor recovery devices to our cars to condense the gasoline out of the air in the tank. That keeps 1 gallon per car per year out of the environment. The equivalent of making all of these spills every two days, but it is invisible. That s why you may have stopped seeing vapor recovery nozzles at the filling station, your car is doing the work now.

2023-01-16 23:40:51.000	This doesn t actually make any sense to me.MSI s BIOS falsely reports to Windows that Secure Boot is enabled. This is very different from just shipping with Secure Boot disabled but available. That would be pretty normal at least of a few years ago - but shipping with a mode where it is enabled, and Windows is convinced that it is enabled, even though it is doing practically nothing - that s an inexcusable situation. Assuming that I interpreted this rather vague statement correctly, of course When we enter the menu, we can see the disappointing default settings. It s doing no verification. It s useless. It s just there to satisfy Windows 11 requirements. OS has no idea that Secure Boot is doing nothing, it just knows that it s enabled .As he says, this would totally break UEFI Spec. Secure Boot being available but disabled is OK and common - Secure Boot being available and saying enabled while actually not checking is a violation.EDIT Actually... the author may be wrong and, counter-intuitively, it may not break spec.

It is a fact today that one in ten thousand of us can make a technological breakthrough capable of supporting all the rest. The youth of today are absolutely right in recognizing this nonsense of earning a living. We keep inventing jobs because of this false idea that everybody has to be employed at some kind of drudgery because, according to Malthusian-Darwinian theory, he must justify his right to exist. So we have inspectors of inspectors and people making instruments for inspectors to inspect inspectors. The true business of people should be to go back to school and think about whatever it was they were thinking about before somebody came along and told them they had to earn a living. -- Buckminster Fuller, 1930
2011-06-19 22:11:40.000	I ve read this story a few times and I always have a few problems with it.1. The total population of New Zealand is 4 million. Expecting 1 million concurrent users on the service is very optimistic. Also Myspace wasn t that popular in New Zealand, these days facebook dominates but previous Bebo was common among young people.2. Testing from EC2 instances against Akamai will not simulate load from NZers. The December 2009 the closest EC2 servers to NZ were in the US so traffic would have been pushing completely different servers.3. A transfer rate of 16Gb s almost certainly exceeds any spare capacity in the New Zealand Internet. Also there are less than a dozen Akamai clusters in NZ, distributed unevenly and probably most don t have more than 1GB s connections.So while it s a nice story, if they were really testing just for NZ they spent a lot of time and money testing the wrong thing. Perhaps it could be a story about how inflated marketing expectations cause cost to be incurred by engineering?

If a company behaves like an established company would, they are not faking anything, they are behaving like an established company would.

The result was that big news from small places often only got to the national or regional desks by Greyhound Package Express. And by then, the news was old, so it rarely made air on the national news.It even happened on a local scale at some stations. The station s own promotions department had a budget and had to purchase commercial time on its own station. Different company, not Westinghouse.

I think Neil Stephenson is great , but find most high literature to be a waste of time. I like various forms of visual art, on the other hand.It s sort of like an old man here in Italy once told me when I asked him how to judge if a wine was good.

The CRAN review process isn t perfect, but it s much less likely that some malicious code accidentally slipped in, or that someone is namesquatting on a popular package name but is not the genuine package. With a random GitHub link I d feel like I need to do this reviewing work every time myself investigate who owns the GitHub repository, what their track record is, what recent commits there are and by whom and how reviewed, etc. That s a lot more work than using the heuristic that CRAN code is probably safe . More mundanely, CRAN typically does a good job with dependencies, and is usually in a working state.I could see alternate curated repositories from CRAN, but to switch from CRAN I d still want some kind of curation.

2023-09-12 15:52:44.000	You re focusing on an imagined attacker performing a single type of attack, and losing sight of more significant avenues for damage. When talking about the possibility of losing money, the main thing you need to do is check your account transactions within 30 days of being issued a statement. This is required so that you can report unauthorized transactions in a timely manner, so that they can be reversed. Transaction authentication essentially doesn t matter, especially in the consumer market - remember banks are still happily chugging along printing a withdrawal key on the front of every check. Any impediment to verifying your transactions in a timely manner, including for example discontinuing OFX Direct Connect access in the name of 2FA , increases the chance that you might miss the dispute period and actually lose money.

Hadoop comes with a distributed cache that is generally used for small files -- a common example would be doing a large join against a small table that would fit in memory. For example if you wanted to filter out stopwords or something, the currently accepted way is to put this stopword list into the resources directory of your JAR, which is not really optimal for data that might change frequently. for discussions related to Cascalog and have not seen any info on using Cascalog alongside Avout, but the idea makes sense.

I estimate at 10x-15x productivity boost in C over JS.The C tooling is just that good.Now if I d been trying to learn XAML or something at the same time, eh, probably wouldn t have gone as well.Of course the downside here is that a Winforms app is hard to distribute, and usable only on Windows desktops.The react web app was, well, beautiful, and usable everywhere.But I could have written the C app once for every platform I care about and still been better off.Ugh, I am sad that Winforms is only ever going to be Win32 based.

2021-02-15 16:32:08.000	Unfortunately not. There is a huge safety difference between a negative pressure test fit check below and a test with an actual aerosol qualitative fit test . All of the FFP2 respirators I have checked pass one and fail the other. I am hoping the Narwallmask can fill this gap.From to the associated time and costs, some health officials propose the elimination of fit testing and advocate that a fit check is sufficient in determining respirator fit 39 . The NIOSH conducted a study that demonstrated protection of N95 FFP2 masks improved from 67 without fit testing to 96 with fit testing 40 . Subsequently, NIOSH determined fit check alone to be insufficient and fit testing should be mandatory when selecting filtering facepiece respirators or elastomer half mask respirators.Three studies that included 1111 Asians assessed the ability of fit check to detect leak determined by a quantitative fit test 36, 41, 42 . Average range sensitivity and specificity of the fit check to correctly detect leak were 26 14 40 and 79 58 92 , respectively, and consequent average range fit test pass rate following successful fit check was 56 34 73 . Another study found the protection factor of filtering facepiece respirators increased from 3.3 to 20.5 when comparing the results of the entire test panel with those who had passed the fit test 32 . However, non fitted filtering facepiece respirators are still likely to provide greater protection than surgical masks, with a measured protection factor of 1.2 Table 1 32 .In summary, while fit check remains recommended before each use of any respirator to ensure fit on a day to day basis Grade 1C evidence , we recommend not to use fit check as a substitute for fit testing to identify the size and shape of respirator that fits best Grade 1B evidence .

2022-02-14 18:14:30.000	I think preference that just comes from familiarly. In practice you don t set your temperature in half increments in places with Celsius, it s just 20, 21, etc. Most HVACs do not set temperature that accurately enough in a room anyway for 0.5C adjustments to actually be useful.If you come from a Celsius place and then move to the USA, you find it actually fairly annoying, because a bunch of useful numbers to remember is arbitrary as fuck. What is the freezing point again? 35, 37, 33? In Celsius it s 0 and very easy to remember. The freezing point is very useful, since you ll know if the rain will become snow if it s just under 0, or if ice will start forming on the road or not. Similarly what is the boiling point? 200, 205, 210, 212? vs. a nice round easy to understand 100. You can also think about how hot your water can be as a percentage of boiling , so 75 becomes hotness that is 75 the way to boiling .Vast majority of the world also knows that -17 OF is cold as fuck, and there is nothing special about that specific number too! You would also know that -16 and -18 are cold as fuck. Same with 38C 100F . 40C and 39C are also hot! And there are no unique properties about 0F and 100F, unlike 0C and 100C.

2018-02-21 07:23:18.000	Never mind, I just found the answer to my own question but I find it interesting none the less. So as the solution of the three metals cool if done correctly the neodymium will come out of solution to form a mesh of neodymium around the grains of cerium and lanthanum in a similar way that pearlite forms from austinite and ferrite in steel. This will give them a sponge of neodymium to conduct the magnetic field but have the cerium and lanthanum act as filler.To explain what I am talking about way better than I ever could, this video is how heat treating steel will change it s properties and why different steels act the way they do.

It got that way because of incremental implementation. As the article illustrated, you then have to tease out the pieces.I once inherited a large enterprise system that had been designed from the ground up to allow that kind of flexibility. The problem was that there were so many levels of abstraction and indirection in the database and the ORM model that performance was abysmal.
2009-04-27 15:36:14.000	When I returned to the UK I simply wrote the TV licensing authority a letter telling them I didn t have a TV.

I guess the first letter was meant to scare me into paying under the assumption that I had lied.Then they sent me a letter saying that they would pop round at any time of their choosing and check up on me. They have not yet done so, and if they do they are not coming in. It s a private property and they ll have to get a search warrant which means going to a magistrate if they think I m watching TV.

2015-09-14 16:38:38.000	I look back on air travel of former times with incredulity - being able to smoke on a plane is one excerpt that particularly takes the biscuit. Concorde was quite incredible too, but the world has moved on to this new madness of easy-hack TSA locks, bullshit terror stories and lame air miles schemes. As it happens I am looking after a house right now because the occupants have gone on a cheap flight made possible through some frequent flyer scheme. People also used to go mad for Green Shield stamps from garages, racking up far more miles on the road as a sales rep than needed because there was this marginal incentive of rubbish you could get with the Green Shield stamps. It all worked wonderfully for a while and many people were delighted getting things like 50 glass tumblers for their kitchen cupboards.I am sure the people next to the Avis depots around the world are used to people revving up their engines, slamming doors and shouting, but that does not make it right. If you had something important to do, how would you feel if there was someone parking a car every few minutes outside your place to drive off again a few minutes later, repeating ad-nauseum? I personally would not feel happy doing that sort of driving even if I was in some faceless bit of American surburbia where such activity was normal. I might not have cared when I was a teenager but I didn t think very well in those days.I also have connections with Madeira and I have seen the old photos from how things used to be before the E.U. plonked some massive airport and motorway there. It is a small island with a big runway, no surprise people on the island use it instead of hitching a ride on a fishing boat. I have not stood outside the departures lounge to count natives vs tourists but I am sure that whole infrastructure was built for tourism, not so grandma in Funchal can visit her relatives spread out all over the globe.

2011-10-23 08:58:13.000	I think you are greatly overestimating and marginalizing people. Plenty, if not the majority of people have the ability to be innovators at least in some small way. Having worked in a factory before with everyone from managers, engineers, machinists, and line workers... I think you give people too much credit.It may sound elitist, or depressing, but for many people in this world there is no hope of them occupying an intellectual job. Either through sheer genetic lottery, nurture or lack thereof , there are an awful lot of people with not the education or intelligence to become creative innovators. A perfect example is the military, where you take something like operating a jet aircraft and make it more accessible to people. A military aviator requires hundreds, if not thousands of hours of training time, and if you ve ever met one, you d realize that they re sharp as a tack. Aviators are probably some friggin smart people - I do not believe they are at all a good, representative sample of the rest of the population, large segments of which cannot do anything but low-skill labor - and can never be fully retrained to perform as creative intellectual job types.Perhaps their children can, but these people, alive and needing jobs right now, are fucked for life. What can I point to though is history, the history of innovation throughout time. Horses to cars, the transition to computers, the internet, there are so many things that have increased efficiency and people have shifted and adapted and continued to innovate and move forward and there continue to be jobs and task for people. That s OP s point - we are at a turning point where, perhaps, these rules no longer apply. The majority of the world has historically been employed in agriculture or unskilled industrial labor. When we invented the car, carriage makers went out of work - but more unskilled jobs popped up in its place. When the cotton gin was invented, wide swathes of people went out of work - but there was demand for unskilled labor elsewhere. There may be periods of pain and unemployment, but ultimately the majority of these eliminated folk found other, low-skill jobs elsewhere.We are at the first point in history now where we are eliminated unskilled work, but not replacing them with anything other unskilled labor, in any sector. If there s a Wal-Mart greeter created for every factory job lost in the USA, we might be ok, but there really isn t. And the greatest problem is that the gap between an unskilled laborer vs. a creative service-sector innovator is so disparate, that no possibility for retraining exists for the vast majority of the recently-made-redundant.

2015-06-02 13:30:05.000	There are ways to make a lot of money with affiliate marketing, but that can involve a lot of trial and error and can usually does involve bootstrapping with a lot of your own cash or a credit card. Although I know of at least one person who turned millionaire after bootstrapping by maxing out his credit cards, I would never suggest doing that. It s a deep hole to climb out of if you fail and for every success story, there s probably 100 failures not talked about. In short, the successes I ve seen involve buying advertising to get people to a landing page that generates leads with commissions that hopefully pay you back more than you spend getting the traffic. It s a delicate operation that pays well only if you get the landing page and affiliate choices right.I ve also seen wealth generated with mailing lists. This is another affiliate marketing play that can be done without feeling too spammy and can still add value to the user.Similar to a mailing list, a forum can be easy to set up and maintain. Also like a mailing list, if you create a large enough user base, advertising can pay off.One of the better earners is a subscription model for just about anything. Software provided for free with a premium set of features for x per month is a good way to generate a user base more easily.A couple things to keep in mind 1. You will almost always have more success when you re passionate about the subject matter. 2. It will take time. Most overnight successes are preceded by years of ramp-up.
2024-05-12 14:53:27.000	I had a minor procedure a while back - enough that I had to be put under - and asked my nurse if she was happy with her job. She said yeah, she loved it, but she made more money as a barkeep! I was completely shocked, especially considering the hours nurses are expected to work. This was a real nurse, not an aide. I think healthcare is a not-so-great career anymore, again because corporate profits are all that matter.
2023-02-16 14:44:26.000	I actually wrote to Telegram s support team to get more info about this, and it seems the article has a lot of errors. The support rep linked me to this, which is Telegram s response to all of it.

2021-12-15 23:22:46.000	Somewhat disturbing content following! The whole reason these systems are proposed is because detective work is ineffective and the harm is ongoing.In Germany, there recently was a news story about two journalists infiltrating and effectively shutting down an insanely large darknet forum for child abuse material.That story exploded, because evidently, law enforcement could have done a lot better, as all the journalists did was crawling for webhoster-links and reporting the content there - the hosters immediately followed through - terabytes of abuse were deleted. The admins of the forum even spoke with the journalists and told them, literally no one cared before and the whole userbase was caught in surprise.Not-so-much-fun facts IIRC that site had millions of accounts registered apparently at least 1 of men are attracted to children it s been mostly non-commercial, user-made abuse material - strongly motivated by that community s demand.The journalists concluded It s not enough to persecute individuals and gather evidence. It is absolutely imperative to disrupt those communities, too, as those sick people not just consume abuse material, they very much actively promote the abuse itself in their interactions. Now, it s not single hit, lasting solution, but requires constant effort. However terabytes of abuse material are not moved in an instant, and they are surely not delivered via Tor to literally millions of people. Apparently it takes about two people, who know Python, to take down a platform like that. The argument of destroying evidence is moot, as you can easily do both, within law enforcement capabilities. German podcast, interview with one of the journalists articles in shownotes Before everyone s privacy and democratic distribution of power are getting compromised, ... maybe lets make sure law enforcement is actually doing their job first.
2022-01-10 05:13:57.000	It s not that they can t do security without going full authoritarian, I think they do it because they want to go authoritarian. The new security benefits are just a vehicle.They re a lot like the common politician who smuggles horrible laws into relief bills or trade treaties. UEFI especially on the ARM platform and intel ME are to examples of this.
2018-01-03 08:22:36.000	Both of the instances you mention would almost certainly rely or result on, and from, what intelligence might be shared or derived from having that frantic phone call or backroom diplomacy.It s not just who you know, but what intel you can share to strengthen an alliance that matters the most.What troubles me about this article is the after effect on those who might be employed by nation states who seek to better understand our intelligence mechanism, and while I realize that every actor in the schema is a cog in a very complex machine, it stands to reason that if tons of people are leaving public service for the private sector, there is a vast amount of leaky intel out there for the having.I don t think there is anything wrong with consolidation, necessarily, but we need to have stopgaps in place to quell the unwanted outflow of personnel from what is essentially a defense-centered brain trust because of how much we as a public have invested in their training and relied on them to help us stay out of harm s way. I m especially worried about the younger set not to foment discrimination, per se, but maturity does shape one s thinking who may more easily be duped by some seemingly friendly industry that is a shell company for nefarious activity.

2018-01-03 18:42:28.000	They try. They insist on paying doctors as little as possible. They challenge the necessity of procedures. Doctors fight back by choosing to classify procedures in more expensive ways. It s a tug of war. There are whole teams of people at hospitals whose job it is to make as much money as possible by arguing as much as possible with insurance companies over prices and necessary procedures.The fundamental problem is the antagonistic nature of that system, as disconnected from the need of the patient. Doctors want to do more and charge more. Insurance wants to do less and pay less. Nobody is asking whether a procedure is worth what it costs the patient.You can t improve system prices with distant and ignorant downward pressure, even if you re a huge buyer. You just don t have the information and intelligence. Medicare tries that, with the result that it sometimes pays for lots of unnecessary procedures and spends too much, and sometimes insists on prices that are too low and has doctors quit taking it. It doesn t have the information to get it right in either direction, and insurance has the same problem.What is needed is price discrimination at the point of sale. In a very blunt sense, we have this in the patient s decision to go to urgent care rather than the ER. In a broader sense, though, when a doctor says for example they d like to do a test just to be on the safe side, there should be a discussion about how much that test costs and what the consequences might be of not taking it. When someone says for example with respect to end of life care, We can try this very expensive probably-futile procedure , costing the grandkids their inheritance is a not unreasonable piece of that conversation.My experience is that doctors in insurance-dominated environments typically do not even know what their suggested interventions cost. But I once had a conversation with a doctor in a self-pay environment urgent care who said, We did test A, 5, and it s negative. We have the option to do test B which is more accurate with respect to false negatives but 100, but I m pretty sure you don t have it based on other signs. Reeeeally useful conversation if you re looking to save money and understand the consequences of a decision. More of that can bring the price of healthcare down by orders of magnitude. The insurance doctor did test B twice a month without even asking me about it, and probably had a team of specialists ready to argue for its necessity with insurance there was no insurance, I was paying, and I would not have regarded it as worth the cost .
2014-10-14 13:32:23.000	After user testing, I made the warp button beg for attention and added three minimal levels. I can go pretty deep on level generation, also just relying on the vast amount of available material, but I have another concept that is a little stronger and uses about 95 of the code, so I need to cut chase ASAP to get them both to market. I m happy to support both apps, but I believe in the end they will be concept apps, getting me the feedback I need to develop a full product.

It would certainly take longer to significantly reduce the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere, but should still do the job. Instead of introducing new CO2 into the atmosphere by burning newly extracted oil, we would be sequestering some and recycling some.
2022-01-01 12:27:49.000	I was inspired by Nicky Case 0 , but independently recently reached the same conclusion as you have here.In March of 2020 when the pandemic was first hitting the US, before there was an official lock-down, and before any company wide announcement, and without any communication, my entire team had come in on a Friday, and my entire team had stayed home on the Monday. In essence, there was enough information that occurred over the weekend for the wave function to collapse 1 . That s what we re after - if you can illuminate the future in such a way that any other option is no longer an option.I ve got no game-dev experience, so the journey will be long, but I think we re on the right track. 0

2018-01-12 18:25:06.000	This seems to me to be naive at best. Risks were obscured due to the mathematical structure of CDOs, not by hiding money transactions.You could spend all day real time looking at the fact that few of the mortgages in your CDO are failing, and then when they fail systemically, you could watch in real time that a lot of assets that were thought to be pretty robust are not.Your argument seems to be simply that radically more data would enable better predictors. Whether that is true or not, it s unclear whether bitcoin et.al. could help much with delivering that data. If we agree to a contract that I will pay you 5 bitcoin tomorrow in return for 4.9 bitcoin today, that contract is not publically available on bitcoin. Nor is, the fact that a certain money stream is part of a mortgage.So unless you force every contract to be public, blockchain technology will not help you that much. And if you force every contract to be public, then you don t need a blockchain.

2019-02-15 05:38:18.000	Oligarchs and tyrants buy condos in the sky more than brownstones someplace. And 3M isn t a huge amount for a three family home near public transportation, especially a home from the late 1800 s that s attached to other homes and with thousands of dollars a year in upkeep. There s an even more important reason for taxes targeting condos more than the older buildings rental buildings like a 3 or 4 family brownstone have renters, and higher taxes would mean higher rents.All that said, if you build a brand new single or multi-family home someplace, anyplace, the taxes will be pretty high. It s all about the grandfathering of older asessments and a state cap on tax rate increases 20 a year I believe , which is allowed an adjustment if renovation is done or a fresh assessment if it s new .
2023-10-23 12:19:56.000	The only way to know is to go to the page and inspect it using devtools. No Ide will be able to infer which rule is going to apply to any given element.But the problem is that you need to make sure that a given css change is going to affect only a specific set of component. So you need to check all components. Since it will be too time consuming, you will probably skip this step and hope for the best and do some QA to check that nothing is obviously broken .

Alternative sweeteners taste like absolute poison to me. Like I ve accidentally sipped some industrial cleaning chemicals or something.But I m also one of those people that likes cilantro. To some people, it is incredibly nasty and it tastes like soap. My impression is that some people think us cilantro-enjoyers actually enjoy the soapy taste as opposed to simply not experiencing the soapy taste at all.The difference in experience is not because I enjoy the taste of soap. Cilantro just simply does not taste like soap to me! Based on all available anecdotal evidence that is why some people enjoy the taste of artificial sweeteners it actually does taste like sugar or close enough to them and not like they are chugging cleaning fluids. edit softened wording, clarified

It s good for you. As a cyclist you get stronger, faster, more skilled. As a driver, you get more skilled and are forced to stay more alert. All of these things make you and everyone around you safer, so savor and put as much of yourself as possible into your cycling and driving, for everyone s sake.

2018-08-17 14:45:25.000	Sparta - Held off an insane number of Persians with 300 men, though a lot could have been a legendAnd don t forget the 700 Thespians fighting with Sparta. And the 400 Thebans. And there may have been 1000 Spartans, not 300. In any event, our historical sources don t make much tactical sense when taken literally, and there is a great deal of mythical allusion and propaganda going on here. Hey, so if Montezuma and the Aztecs were beaten by 20 guys with superior weaponry this guy would conclude just by the numbers that they were even greater.The Aztecs were defeated largely by the 20,000 Tlaxcala allies of Cortes. But sure, let s ignore the importance of the natives so we can make the Europeans seem righteous and laudatory.

2023-08-04 18:05:30.000	I would definitely be curious to know why - the emulation of Genesis is notably behind most other video game consolesNot sure where you are getting this from but I think that s far from true.For years we had Kega Fusion which was able to run most if not all commercial games without any issues and was the pioneer of accurate Genesis sound emulation.Then we have had emulators like Genesis Plus GX with better accuracy and close to 100 compatibility with all licensed and unlicensed games for quite a few years now.A little more recently, we have Blastem then Ares emulators with devs more focused on improving accuracy for those interested in getting all test ROMs passing in their emus. Sure it isn t the NES emulator scene where you have have like hundreds of emulators to choose from but how many of them are accurate compatible enough? Comparing to other systems from same time area SNES, Neo Geo, PC Engine, etc , I would say Sega 8-bit and 16-bit fans have pretty much similar choices than others.What is sure is that I don t know much system with cycle-accurate C and Verilog emulators based on chips die analysis. That alone shows how much Sega hardware has a dedicated base of talented people still reverse-engineering and documenting it after all these years, even when existing emulators are already good enough to play the majority of games without noticeable issues.

If I still want a fix really bad and author did not respond, or does not want a fix, then fork the project for my own consumption. Using alternative dependencies are also an option.

2013-03-01 14:50:32.000	I think the bigger issue here is not that they can t be fun, it s, basically, coding under duress and how society views programmers. Sure, if you re going to a hackathon to party and hang out, then it s not really a hackathon - it s a party. If you have to produce a usable result, then you will fail.The op is absolutely right - we are constrained by our physical bodies and they require the proper fuel and rest in order to operate at peak efficiency. Just because you re using your brain instead of certain muscles, doesn t mean you can consume garbage. This isn t a bad on your comment as much as is it a comment on society as a whole. The whole Zuck bs legend has really damaged programming on multiple levels and it completely reject that ethos.I ve worked with devs that ate garbage all day, couldn t sleep, always came in late they were non-drinkers too and their job performance sucked. Their attention sucked. Their attitude sucked. Their code sucked. Needless to say they were all fired. But alas, this is a tale not about the voices of reason, but of bs movies and news headlines and even tho the op is critical realistic? of this, that opinion I m sure is in the minority.

2020-12-30 19:41:15.000	I think you re confusing strong weak with static dynamic. The former happens at runtime, the latter at compile time.Strong typing usually describes the combination of compile and runtime typing Haskell code doesn t have types after compilation, so there is no runtime enforcement of typing, but no one calls it weakly-typed, because the static typing prevents any of the conditions which would display weak typing behavior fromm happening.

2022-07-15 11:20:35.000	Urgh, no thank you.From progression of a long-term exposure to drugs toward the development of substance use disorders and addicted behaviors is often associated with deficits in decision making Koob and Volkow, 2010 Wiers et al, 2007 . FMRI demonstrates altered brain activity in core regions linked to the motivational and affective aspects of decision making Cousijn et al, 2012 Vaidya et al, 2012 , mainly in the ventromedial prefrontal VMPFC and orbitofrontal cortices and insula. In this regard, it has been demonstrated that substance-dependent individuals and patients with VMPFC lesions exhibit similar behaviors that lead them to make similar decisions in real life, preferring choices that bring immediate benefits even if coupled with negative consequences Bechara and Damasio, 2002 .In our study, we complement the functional evidence of altered activity in nodes related to decision making by showing in regular cannabis users a decrease in gray matter volume in the insula, orbitofrontal cortex, and precuneus, regions that are part of the motivational and affective components of this network.

2017-04-06 14:07:43.000	As someone who started creating web apps in 1995, I think that view is mostly based on memories of subjective perception pages were smaller, yes, but people expected the web to be slow in the dial-up era and were less likely to remember a site which loaded in 5 seconds as slow when everything was like that now that some pages are Google.com fast the expectation is much less forgiving.That s not to say that there haven t been problems with ads, gratuitously bloated JavaScript, etc. but it s easy to forget that back in the 90s there were a ton of pages which only worked well on then-fast T1 connections or relied on Java or Shockwave not Flash, the Macromedia plugin before Adobe acquired them and took a solid 30 seconds of swapping just to start up.The one thing we ve definitely seen a big regression on were pages which cannot be used if any part of a huge amount of JavaScript fails, and I m really glad that mobile devices have been reminding the entire industry why progressive enhancement is still critically important.

2010-01-23 21:04:41.000	So, what should you do if someone keeps calling you a crypto-nazi in a televised debate? I m pretty sure that if Buckley and Vidal had been having a debate about civil rights, and Buckley repeatedly called Vidal a crypto-faggot , under the pretense that doing so was vaguely related to civil rights, and then if Vidal had made a rejoinder similar to the one quoted, you d be applauding it.Remember, it was Vidal s essay about Buckley that twice inspired libel suits and forced Esquire to print an apology.

Appeals to authority like saying but everybody uses that word are completely beside the point.You re in 100 agreement with myself and GP if you say that poaching is commonly used to mean trying to hire someone from another company. But that has nothing to do with what GP is talking about. They are saying they really wish people wouldn t use that term, despite it being commonly used.Understood?Or maybe you already knew that but really like putting people down on the internet.
2019-07-08 22:48:26.000	if there were the political willLegislating what humans are allowed to want and need and then calling that post scarcity has led to immense suffering over the past century. It continues to be a temptation of authoritarians who want a utopian society and want it now.Perhaps you meant something else? Do you think if we just had more intelligent robots to do our work for us we wouldn t need to work anymore? I think it s impossible to do it with existing technology, although I wouldn t rule out future technology. This is where basic income enters the discussion as a bridge from scarcity to post-scarcity.As an addendum, I believe we are approaching post-scarcity for a higher and higher percent of the population who are perfectly happy with what they have this includes early retirement, financial independence, long sabbaticals, etc. .

2022-07-24 04:42:36.000	I don t think Google Search got worse, as in, I don t think changes they made directly made search a worse experience than not adding the change. I think that spam posters, scammers, et al., have gotten much better at gaming SEO, that Google got stuck with two bad options 1 do nothing and have all common search terms loaded with spam, scams, and viruses, or 2 change how their search works to lessen the amount of bad actors, but also reduce the good search outcomes showing up.Maybe I m wrong. This is just a hunch based on looking at how big online communities fail, and how services that rely on user generated content fail. At a certain scale, you can no longer rely on people being good actors with light moderation. You need to tighten up moderation, even if it means making the community overall worse than it s peak. As, the alternative is letting the bad actors make it even worse than that.More and more lately I ve been coming across spam, reposted content from sites like StackOverflow, w3schools, Reddit, etc., but posted on different domains, on a page plastered with ads. To me, this is a peak into the arms race between Google s Search trying to return good results, and bad actors trying to get their spam to the front results.

2021-10-25 13:29:12.000	Trivia time!The windows console host conhost provides the UI for nano server. Even on desktop Windows, it s built with support for running without a window manager. The rendering engine is named wddmcon and it lives in our repository at 1 it s pretty much the most barebones console renderer we have. Reverse video and most color support were obviously 2 never implemented even though I would have liked to spend engineering effort on it. The decision predates me, but I suspect it s because they weren t necessary for local validation.Wddmcon eventually evolved into the rendering engine used in Windows Terminal 3 it s still not very good 4 , but it works in conhost as well. Eventually, we can bring those changes or whatever future rendering engine we write back to wddmcon.It has a sister renderer, bgfxcon . Bgfxcon renders text to the blue screen boot graphics driver in the event that WDDM is unavailable.If you manage to open multiple full-screen console sessions, you can flip between them using Alt-Tab. This service is provided by the console I O server , a CSRSS component available only on Nano Server that mimics some of the user32 things conhost needs, such as keyboard input. It also handles brokering us a WDDM or BGFX handle on startup. Unfortunately, that one s closed-source not because it should be, but because disentangling the build process for a component that lives in CSRSS wasn t on our critical path. 1 which the article has already called out! 3

It definitely is not easy but that s more to do with how you organize things than with the actual complexity of the code and a microkernel is super helpful with this aspect, it is far easier to hit the right structure than with a macrokernel, you re more or less forced into doing it right without any way to give in to the temptation of taking a sneak peak at a data structure that isn t yours.

2018-07-14 02:25:06.000	I think it depends on your implementation.For example, I tend to use Mongoose as the interface to Mongo, with which you re required to set a Schema for each collection of documents. You can easily set every single field type to Mixed analogous to any , auto , etc , but if you re the least bit disciplined you can set any fields to any variation of String Number Date Buffer Boolean Mixed ObjectId Array Decimal128 Map there are TypeScript typings supplied for Mongoose, so I typically recreate the models as TS interfaces for wherever I use them in other parts of my code. It s extremely intuitive and quick to develop. It s a tad redundant defining the Schema types, and then a TS interface, but I usually don t mind. I include them in the same file for coherence so that I m always importing from the same module for anything relating to the model.For a basic example MyCollection.ts import Document, Model, model, Schema, Types from mongoose export interface IMySchemaFields _id? Types.ObjectId name string age? number fungi boolean ET? phone home owwww export type TMySchemaDocument Document IMySchemaFields export type TMySchemaModel Model export const MySchema Schema new Schema _id Schema.Types.ObjectId NOTE name String, age Number, fungi Boolean, ET String, export const MyCollection TMySchemaModel model myCollection , MySchema NOTE there are a couple of quirks. Mongoose uses constructors to define types whereas TypeScript types are a different symbol understood only by the compiler so in this case they use different aliases of the same object...So when I move to make any queries via the ODM, I import and use the associated types. The types won t allow you to reference fields that don t exist on the schema that way. You can force it by cheating the compiler and casting any arbitrary non-existent field to , but I try to reserve that for hungover POC cases. It does suggest immutability of the object received from the query, but again there are many ways to ignore that if you wanted to, or just didn t care.Example ODM query MyController.ts import as mongoose from mongoose import MyCollection, IMySchemaFields from .. models MyCollection.ts ... pretend there s relevant stuff happening here MyCollection.findOne _id 436rgerr25gw4gfdhdsf , , error Error, collection IMyCollectionFields, any Do something with your collection object. Just don t try to access, modify, or add fields that don t exist on the referenced interface. More things probably happen here As for TypeScript for a large project... I think we get into different kinds of discussions here eg, is Node or Deno the right tool, etc etc . The kind of applications I ve used this design on have not had to face significant scaling or load problems. They re very applied circumstances that face small-to-medium large traffic. I haven t benchmarked for anything that operated on a real significant scale. We will be testing for around the 1k-2k concurrent user mark later this summer. But that doesn t involve consistent read writes it will involve regular reads, but seldom writes. I might try to write about it later, but it s kind of a fast-track thing so I m a bit buried in it.Other projects following a similar design tend to be internal tooling for editorial and other teams in media and so don t see significant traffic or structures changes beyond initial versions.I can understand many peoples reservations and concerns. I definitely think it s a matter of what s right for the job, considering the circumstances and resources available.
2022-05-06 18:34:54.000	That s a fair criticism. Deep down, I usually have a pretty high opinion of my abilities. I think I m pretty good at hiding it in person, but I m less good at hiding it in my writing. I feel happiest and most excited to write when I m thinking about some of my happiest memories. I try to also be open about the mistakes I ve made. I ve generally been much more lucky than skilled.I ve definitely written more than one bug where post-mortem estimates were over 10,000 in losses.August 20, 2013, I finished a code change in Hong Kong to Goldman s global algorithmic trading system and sent it out to a colleague in Europe to review. A friend of mine was a machine learning person in our Tokyo office and was in town for work, so a bunch of us had dinner and a small number of drinks. I stopped by the office on my way home to check if the change had been approved. It had, and I hesitated a bit to put it in production, because I had a couple of drinks and it was late at night. However, rationalized that I had written all of the code while awake and without a drop of alcohol, and pushed the change into production.I woke up the next morning to read news 1 that Goldman had lost up to 100 million dollars in an automated trading problem within 1-2 hours after I pushed my change. I couldn t see how my change could possibly have caused that error, but was still a bit panicked until I reassured myself that my cell phone would have been called once a minute until I woke up if I had made a change that caused a loss of that magnitude.I went into the office and saw that a chat window I had open with a friend in the NY office showed presence unknown . An email sent to them bounced. So, I walked over to the derivatives Flow Strats desk, sat down in an empty chair next to one of my friends, and just quietly said ... so and the name of my friend in NY. My friend on the Flow desk s eyes got wide and he said how did you know? . I actually didn t know until the Flow Strat s reaction confirmed my guess.My friend in New York was actually very careful, but he had been working under time pressure late at night and pushed a bug into production. He d been more responsible than I had the night before. I got really lucky, and he got really unlucky. He s actually a really solid engineer. He caught plenty of very subtle bugs in other people s code, at least once when he hadn t been asked to review the code.After August 20, 2013, if at all possible, I push changes into production before noon, and not on Fridays.If memory serves the maybe 100 million ended up being around 28 million.And that s the time that I could have easily caused a 28 million loss.There was also a time I misplaced a paren and had a bad actor noticed, they could have used 60 million customer computers in a DDoS UDP traffic amplification attack. My test cases weren t matching my hand-worked-out examples, but I eventually just gave up and assumed my code was correct and put incorrect values in the message authentication code test vectors. Never roll your own crypto, especially if your test vectors aren t coming out as you expect. That was 2004. 1

2024-04-20 22:06:15.000	unions in Europe are a lot weaker than in the US. Maybe in other countries, but certainly not in Germany. I grew up in the southern US, and am still astounded at how strong and effective unions are here, even in conservative Bavaria. I m in IT, but employed under a permanent contract that was negotiated by and is enforced by IG Metall, the industrial union for all non-management employees of lots of companies, regardless of job function. For example, Germany requires that employers give 24 paid vacation days per year. The contract I signed has 30.As the post-COVID inflation spun up, they pretty quickly got us an 8 across-the-board pay increase without much drama, because they re taken pretty seriously by management, and that s on top of lots of little increases over the years.I don t adore everything IG Metall does, but I have trouble even imagining a comparable situation in the US, especially the southern US.
2024-02-03 03:09:40.000	If you add all the pieces in your first paragraph together, the obvious answer is people need to stop giving all their money to 1 institution that they can t assess the creditworthiness of. It is a bad idea. Even if the money is then backstopped. The current system encourages them to do this.And you say lost their life savings as though the current system doesn t do that. Anyone who has attempted to hold their life savings in a bank is being gently wiped out by inflation. We traded might happen for government policy that this will happen . They re losing most of the value in their cash every 25 years. The official policies are consistently inflation combined with low interest rates. Be prepared for crypto s 1929 moment.Hasn t it has already lost 80 of its value more than once? I d hope people are prepared with a history like that.
2013-11-13 03:13:12.000	It looks like the author prides himself on reinventing ideas. I ve read a handful of his other posts, and he s reinvented the Y combinator, the proof of the halting problem, and other such things. It appears that, perhaps partially by a perpetual mishap with diction and connotation, the author claims that his reinventions are original ideas, his opinions are fact, or that his insights are somehow deeper or his arguments are better.I see this happen all the time, with myself and with others, and I think it s a common thing in mathematics the author is in CS, so he might not get exposed to this as much as I do . I ve seen undergrads finally realize that calculus makes sense and explain how much deeper their understanding is now that they ve really thought about it, and I smile and nod my head. I ve myself touted my own deep understanding like it s not completely trivial to somebody with years of experience.I think this article shares that sentiment. The author has thought of on his own accord what we all consider a dead and beaten horse, and is shouting his thoughts from his proverbial mountaintop no paradigm is perfect for every situation.Best of luck to him for all his thoughts, but he d better learn when and where to curb his enthusiasm if he wants others to take him seriously. For the record, this doesn t apply to his personal blog. I expect sooner or later he ll have a post talking about how Haskell s pure style is all about giving the sculpter more clay.

2015-07-15 16:43:45.000	I ve been partially remote for the past 5 years, averaging 2-3 days a week in the office. During that time I ve also had stints of being fully remote while overseas for a few months at a time. The fully remote time is vastly more productive, but could be very difficult regarding communication. The work environment wasn t designed to be remote-first, and this puts a strain on anybody who isn t in the office.In my experience remote all-the-way works wonderfully. Remote partially suffers around communication when the rest of the team doesn t emphasize asynchronous tools like chat comments email.

For pretty much every single smartphone-based threat vector, it is a free lunch for attackers. We re talking off-the-shelf CVE exploits versus blowing a multi-million dollar zero-day here.
2012-05-23 14:46:13.000	When a patent is granted, or 18 months after its filing, it s published. Until that time there s no obligation to disclose and no attorney would ever advise it. If the USPTO should rule it not patentable, it could still be a very valuable trade secret.
2023-08-02 22:05:24.000	Thanks for the reply ...Perhaps ... there is one thing we did not see ...Is there assurance in SQS to ensure that what is first processed is actually what is first? i.e. process these in the order of the row number - not the order you receive them. Meaning - typically with outside systems we have a list of messages ... we need these 1000 messages processed in order ...... with push pop - we could typically ensure the first message is the first message ...... For SQS - how do we ever ensure the first message and every subsequent message is the actual order we desire? Not the order the internet arbitrarily delivered them

There will always be a market for dirty coins, and there won t be one definition of dirty either. The countermeasure is a multitude of such tracking tools, each operating on an opt-in basis, each with a different definition of dirty . Then merchants and users would be able to choose what provenance has what value.In fact, there is an opening now for someone to build an alternative system that isn t associated with regulators. One that perhaps might help us track stolen coins, like those from Pirate 40. On the other hand as a voluntaryist I happen to believe that DPR the other pirate deserved his coins, and I would accept his coins at face value.If such an open-data solution existed, then I would feel inclined to support merchants and exchanges that reported their bitcoin addresses, knowing that a if their funds get stolen, people have the opportunity to reject the stolen coins thus reducing their value and the incentive to steal and b the public can perform audits on these bitcoin exchanges. On the other hand I wouldn t feel comfortable with a closed solution where the data gets walled off from the public, which selectively benefits those with access to the data.The future of bitcoins will be full of unexpected surprises that seem obvious in hindsight. I think this is one of them. To the moon!

2023-08-21 18:19:57.000	There is a huge confusion about this double pumped thing.All that this means is that Zen 4 uses the same execution units both for 256-bit operations and for 512-bit operations. This means that the throughput in instructions per cycle for 512-bit operations is half of that for 256-bit operations, but the throughput in bytes per cycle is the same.However the 512-bit operations need fewer resources for instruction fetching and decoding and for micro-operation storing and dispatching, so in most cases using 512-bit instructions on Zen 4 provides a big speed-up.Even if Zen 4 is double pumped , its 256-bit throughput is higher than that of Sapphire Rapids, so after dividing by two, for most instructions it has exactly the same 512-bit throughput as Sapphire Rapids, i.e. two 512-bit register-register instructions per cycle.The only exceptions are that Sapphire Rapids with the exception of the cheap SKUs can do 2 FMA instructions per cycle, while Zen 4 can do only 1 FMA 1 FADD instructions per cycle, and that Sapphire Rapids has a double throughput for loads and stores from the L1 cache memory. There are also a few 512-bit instructions where Zen 4 has better throughput or latency than Sapphire Rapids, e.g. some of the shuffles.

I didn t pay full attention to it but my download installation took about 2 hours IIRC. I do have two other HDDs though, so Windows 10 may have spent some time indexing files which increased the installation time.Also did the upgrade at a clients computer, typical low-end consumer Toshiba laptop at a 15 Mbps line, it took about 6-7 hours.

2021-05-07 20:51:02.000	Needing a LD_PRELOAD on a system where LD_PRELOAD is blocked.Sure it still requires you to have rights to create run a executable.But it s a much better model then LD_PRELOAD as it can only be used on executable you can write to, which normally means you your user group but not other user group owned executables. Which is especially relevant with suid sgid.You can also use this, to patch a library which is compiled in a way where LD_PRELOAD doesn t work. Like suid binaries. Through you have to potentially make a copy and set the suid bit again.

Also how do you know it s not just others forcing him to have the hardest issues to resolve issues or that his performance is not being hampered by problems elsewhere in the chain?If I were ever to manage again performance metrics would be the least of my concerns when trying to deliver a product.

It could be just that they want to reap all the benefits of Russian resources by being the only place that will really trade with them in any capacity, but if they start supplying Russians with weapons and pushing towards escalating the conflict.....who knows what will happen. I really don t think a conflict with NATO is completely off the table, as suicidal as it would be for Russia and everyone else . And with China s backing, they could be emboldened to do something that will push everyone over the edge.

We do care how it got to produce incorrect information.If you have a robot duck that walks like a duck and quacks like a duck and you dust off your hands and say whelp that settles it, it s definitely a duck then you re going to have a bad time waiting for it to lay an egg.Sometimes the issues beyond the superficial appearance actually are important.

So just do the same thing with gallons of gas measured down to the cc, if you wanted.PS There are such things as fractional shares of stock.The current system has no convenient general way to transfer their wealth in AAPL stocks from yourself to any person without going through an intermediaryWhy is this relevant at all? Are you trying to say that Bitcoin is a more convenient form of currency than stock? No kidding.Buying Bitcoin mean you are putting faith into the systemAnd other people are selling, which means they are losing faith in the system.A stock is priced by the market based on the current value of all expected future dividend payments. Growth stocks are just one more abstraction removed but in the end it all comes down to expected future earnings. One-tenth of a company that will earn 10 a year every year from now to eternity has a value you can work out on paper.

2024-04-28 07:38:17.000	Betteridge s law not withstanding, for the first time in human history, things like loneliness have become the subject of scientific inquiry. This has happened over the last 50ish years, if that.As Feynman says, figuring out which of our theories are true, and which of our ideas are subject to the illusion of explanatory depth is important. Especially when it comes to things we think we know, like interpersonal relationships and our own psychology.True, the social sciences are quite young compared to other scientific fields. But already we have estimates for distinguishing what impacts between and within person variation in loneliness. At the moment, most of this work is done at a very general level the work tries to characterize various populations of people.However, one of the newer more cutting-edge methods of studying things like loneliness involves pinging them multiple times a day to see how their emotional state is changing over time. So called Ecological Momentary Assessments if you are curious. Some researchers are using such designs to try and figure out model what makes an individual tick.Clinical psychology, anecdotal folk wisdom, research psychology, and potentially even Neuroscience will eventually converge. In my opinion, one semi-unique challenge is that the set of skills that makes one a good researcher and one a good people person are not highly correlated. This doesn t matter for Chemistry etc. , but I think it matters more for the social sciences.

It was a helpful metaphor, one that may have saved the McIlvaines marriage. But when I mentioned it to Roxane Cohen Silver, a psychology professor at UC Irvine who s spent a lifetime studying the effects of sudden, traumatic loss, she immediately spotted a problem with it That suggests everyone will make it down, she told me. Some people never get down the mountain at all. It s not clear if all the family members in the story made it down.

2015-01-26 05:07:45.000	Definitely go with an inexpensive theme.It s a great value, gives you good design out of the box and lets you focus on building the more critical elements of your service.Design is important. Initially though you just need something that looks good, quickly and inexpensively. Once you re profitable you can invest in better design.I would go with bootstrap based themes. I see more and more corporate sites using bootstrap. It looks good and is easy to develop with.As others have mentioned if your site is SaaS watch out for themeforest and their license requirements. Otherwise you ll be in love with a theme that will require an extended license that is 500 to 1,000. More friendly license terms for SaaS are offered by I d look there first.Good luck getting up and running fast.

2019-07-14 14:10:49.000	There is still quite a bit of friction at the seams to the core language though. If you write a plain templated function, you have to wrap it in a lambda or some other functor type, or std function I guess before you can do anything with it except calling it. Pattern matching is also quite verbose currently.Whether this matters really depends on the code you re trying to write of course.

2022-02-19 18:14:56.000	The underlying bug in log4j is having a deserialization mechanism that can automatically deserialize to any class in the system, combined with method code that runs upon deserialization that does dangerous things. It has nothing to do with GC at all.It s a recurring problem in dynamic scripting languages where the language by its very nature tends to support this sort of functionality. It s actually a bit weird that Java has it because statically-typed languages like that don t generally have the ability to do that, but Java put a lot of work into building this into its language. Ruby has a very large issue with this a few years back where YAML submitted to an Ruby on Rails site would be automatically deserialized and execute a payload before it got to the logic that would reject it if nothing was looking for it. Python s pickle class has been documented as being capable of this for a long time, so the community is constantly on the lookout for things that use pickle that shouldn t, and so far they ve mostly succeeded, but in principle the same thing could happen with that, too.It would be nearly impossible for Go a GC d language to have that class of catastrophic security error, because there is nowhere the runtime can go to get a list of all classes for any reason, including deserialization purposes. You have to have some sort of registry of classes. It s possibly to register something that can do something stupid upon unmarshaling, but you have to work a lot harder at it.Go is not unique. You don t see the serialization bugs of this type in C or C either non-GC d languages , because there s no top-level registry of all classes function whatever in the system to access at all. You might get lots of memory safety issues, but not issues from deserializing classes that shouldn t be deserialized simply because an attacker named them. Many other languages make this effectively impossible because most languages don t have that top-level registry built in. That s the key thing that makes this bug likely.

2015-05-28 12:39:58.000	Hmmm... And I did this had fb for a few years, deleted for a few, had for a semester abroad, deleted as soon as I had my first steady girlfriend, broke up and now about three and a half years later I m back on . The problem I found was, as soon as I deleted my fb no one had my e-mail as it was deleted with it my account and messages.I m not the biggest fan of facebook obviously, but when I wqs studying abroad in France it really was a handy way to connect with people when I didn t have a cellphone. Now, after deleting for such a long period, I don t have any connection to my old friends which is a shame.There s the argument that if people wanted to talk to you they d make it happen but then there s the argument that if you re on facebook people are more likely to talk to you because of the convenience. No one wants to lose touch, and facebook provides and easy way to make sure that had I not deleted when I wanted to go back to Europe I d have easy access for communication lines to the individuals I might want to visit.Everything is double edged and while I ve enjoyed my time off of facebook why does everyone have to hate on the poorest in America? I will never understand. If the people on welfare were actual leechers maybe they d own a portion of the country, anyways I digress .That being said, it s a total privacy invasion, and the people I apparently know don t critically think too often unfortunately even as I try to gently prod, and yet, it has allowed me to find events I might not have gone too, and friends I may not have seen.I hate to do this to hackernews where the discussion is the key reason I come here... but I did not read the article. Sorry!
2018-11-05 14:13:53.000	Apple Inc. shares had their worst day since 2014 amid concerns that growth in its powerhouse product, the iPhone, is slowing. In the fiscal fourth quarter, Apple said iPhone unit sales barely grew from a year earlierWhy do sales always need to grow, why sustaining is not enough?Also wouldn t it be a good idea to change the focus product periodically? I.e. we ve sold so much iPhones that everybody who ever wanted one has one already, let s focus on making MacBooks great again so more people would consider getting one or upgrading their old one, then once some time has passed and everybody has a new Mac let s start selling new iPhones we were developing during this time that is so much better thst everybody is willing to upgrade again... IMHO inflating sales growth by releasing a new not-much-better model of the same product every year or two is hardly a healthy sustainable practice.

Should there be, whatever costs are associated with that will shift the equation here.In the meantime, you re stuck with the reality that whatever mass you plan on transporting to the asteroid, and whatever mass is required to haul back your loot, needs to be boosted from Earth s surface to LEO.The tyranny of the rocket equation dictates what delta-v costs you. Trips with burns at both ends are vastly more expensive than those with burns at only one. So, yes, aerobraking on return to Earth is a highly cost-effective method, but that s going to require budgeting for the mass of your reentry shielding and landing mechanism likely parachutes .Ultimately, you re looking at a high-speed, high-temperature reentry, atmospheric slowing, and an ultimate soft-ish landing of whatever you ve recovered.While ion rockets have been proposed as vastly more mass-efficient than chemical rockets, existing designs based on xeon rely on an element whose prevalence in known space environments is quite low. The one exception is Jupiter, but that s the second deepest gravity well in the Solar System Within the Solar System, the nucleon fraction of xenon is 1.56 10 8, for an abundance of approximately one part in 630 thousand of the total mass. 53 Xenon is relatively rare in the Sun s atmosphere, on Earth, and in asteroids and comets. The planet Jupiter has an unusually high abundance of xenon in its atmosphere about 2.6 times as much as the Sun.

2024-09-17 12:27:57.000	In bioinformatics we use a modified gzip format called bgzip that exploits this fact heavily. The entire file is made of concatenated gzip chunks. Each chunk then contains the size of the chunk stored in the gzip header . This lets you do random access inside the compressed blocks more efficiently.Sadly, the authors hard coded the expected headers so it s not fully gzip compatible you can t add your own arbitrary headers . For example, I wanted to add a chunk hash and optional encryption by adding my own header elements. But as the original tooling all expects a fixed header, it can t be done in the existing format.But overall it is easily indexed and makes reading compressed data pretty easy.So, there you go - a practical use for a gzip party trick!
2012-02-08 00:54:15.000	There s actually some serious questions about that. In interviews, Bosanke has claimed to be paying a 35.8 tax rate. She s been a little coy about her income, but in one interview she claimed to only make 60,000 a year.Anyone with even a passing familiarity with the US tax code will quickly understand that this is not possible. Seriously. So we know that at least some of what she s claimed in wrong. And since Bosanke won t release her tax returns, that s really as far as we can go.In short, the Buffet secretary talking point really has no evidentiary value for either side. We simply have no idea what she makes or what she pays all we know is what she s publically claimed is wrong.
2012-02-21 19:21:47.000	I believe this is how it should be. Most popular music today is mass produced by rather untalented people. I wouldn t even call them artists. They assemble components into something that works. Much like a programmer. But are programmers labelled as artists?Music from an artist is generally produced from an internal artistic drive. These mass produced tracks are simply made to make money. They cause the industry to be inflated because they probably wouldn t have become successful or even have been made without huge amounts of backing capital.In other words, if the value of the industry was based on artistic merits, how much do you think it would be valued at?

Your IoT stove, IoT coffee maker, IoT washing machine, IoT lights, etc do not need to be secure if they are behind a secure gateway. And, besides, a private network is only private until one of the devices gets compromised. Then it s not private anymore.The gateway makes sure that nobody but you will be able to access and thus compromise your IoT freezer. Better to make your device capable of living on the real, hostile Internet.Sure, but considering the amount of IoT botnet that is out there I do not think that this is going to happen.

Implement support for TC plugins, you will gain enormous ecosystem for almost free.Check its viewer and find in files options utf8 utf16 regex office files and then combining everything with git plugin or one of other plugins where commit comment contains something not matching to another regexp. And on top of everything it is very simple to make it happen .Do study TC, it is by far the most complete file manager on any system, in any time and extremely well thought of. There is just nothing that compares beyond I have two pane file manager .It is visually outdated and it doesn t run on all platforms but it is really really hard to beat in features like rename all .cpp in all directories and subdirectories to filename - dateofcreation - gitrevision - gitbranch .cpp or use parts of exif header to rename file . I would love to have multiplatform alternative as I have dumped the windows due to w8 and w10 abominations for TC but I just dont see how this could be achived without really, REALLY huge engineering effort.You might figure out that it is not worth competing against it for its licence price of 37 euros 27 for students and shareware version without limitations except nag screen.

That way you would have the full power of the language, yet newbies would be able to get something done in it.For instance the flow of the program could consist of a number of boxes stacked on top of each other, illustrating the flow. Each box would have one or more lines showing the input and output, and when clicked it would open up showing either the boxes it contains funtions, nethods, code snippets etc. or the raw code if you re at the lowest level. You can click the boxes-within-boxes until you reach the raw code at the bottom.The user would be able to drag boxes into his program, from simple ones that just print something to the screen Two lines input text and output text to complex methods and functions.The whole thing could probly be coded up in emacs.Note that this is just a wild idea, and there are probably tons of things I haven t thought of. It s pretty interesting though.

Even your post right now that I disagree with, you likely didn t get paid to post.That content on Facebook that keeps people coming back? It s not the ads or deals What keeps people coming back is what their friends, families, and idols post. They re effectively generating content for Facebook which they are then profiting off of for free .The straw man argument here is that Facebook is providing the platform and that is how people are compensated for their content. It s kind of fair, but it s been wildly abused. There are competitors, but it s the lock in and invasion that has given Facebook it s value not choice.There is no informed opt-in, discussion or debate about the value you provide to Facebook in exchange for the value they get out of you. That is the cash-cow Facebook has been milking and when given an informed choice people are now saying, No, I m worth more than this garbage. I m tearing into Facebook because that s the target of this post but that content is provided on every platform. The value is in what the users are providing not the platform. Reddit, Hacker News, TikTok, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, Google Everything. The content is provided by the users for free to the platforms.

The fact that we re using IPv4 with NAT SPI versus IPv6 with SPI is simply an accident of history.If IPv4 had been designed with 64-bit addresses, or even 48-bit ones like Ethernet MACs, which we still haven t run out of , then NAT probably would not have been invented, and we d be using simple SPI firewalls see Cheswick 1994 . but I wouldn t trust it as much as the security of a non-routable network.Non-routable networks are not more secure than routable ones with SPI at best the two are equal IMHO. Non-routable networks may actually be worse because of a false sense of security all it may take is one end-point compromise and the enemy is one the other side of the moat.

Those people tend to be a terrible match for me.I m happier with people who value my humor, personality and the way I treat them.It s not any more complicated than that.
2020-07-30 18:31:02.000	The restaurant industry figured the hiring way better than the software engineering industry! They test both professional skills and cultural alignment! In other words, they test your ability to deliver. They do not ask you to explain a recipe by heart or describe how you would chop the onion. They ask you to do it. Live. It s ironic that the article points out the error in blindly imitating others and then we get this entirely apples and oranges recipe for effective interviews .What are the fixed costs of having a live chop the onions and shoot the breeze on slack for software companies? For a restaurant, they simply need a bit of tabletop for the new workstation .- All onions are pretty much the same in one industry in our industry, we famously have a new way to slice onions every other day! Let s not even discuss the variety of knives ..- What secret sauce info is disclosed during the live getting to know each other? Can we just put candidates in company slack and check out how it works? Seems problematic.
2024-06-10 10:49:58.000	Drawing compasses are precision instruments, quite complex to manufacture and adjust, which involved hundreds of tiny design and manufacturing improvements over several centuries of expert craftsmanship practical knowledge now lost, except some textual summaries in 19th century books, 20th century catalogs, and scattered patents . You can t buy anything made today that is anywhere close to the quality of professional compasses from the late 19th century, and quite likely never will be able to again in the future. It is sterile.A good Photoshop operator or with more time and effort and less capability, a good dye transfer printer with a working darkroom, starting from the most sterile negative you can imagine will blow any film stock you like totally out of the water.You like having a large company s engineers force their creative preferences about color interpretation onto your art. Other artists prefer to deliberately make those choices for themselves.Neither workflow is inherently better or worse, but some approaches are better suited to some personalities and artistic goals.

2019-11-30 16:28:57.000	I think one reason why it doesn t make sense to a lot of people is that when doing long division, it is taught with notational shortcuts that obscure what the student is really doing.Eg, say you are dividing 76543 by 5. The normal procedure is to say something like - 5 goes into 7 once. The first quotient digit is 1.- 1 times 5 is 5, write that under the 7, and draw a short line under the five- 7 minus 5 is 2 write that under the line you just drew- the next digit is 6, so write that next to the 2 you just drew, ie, 26- 5 goes into 26 five times put that up in the quotient, etcThat minimizing the writing, but it hides what is really happening.Really what is going on is this. How many times can you subtract 5 from 76543? One procedure would be to subtract five over and over until the remainder is less than five. The number of times you subtracted is the quotient. But in this example you d have to subtract more than 15000 times. Instead of subtracting 5 at a time and incrementing a count, it would be faster to subtract 50 at a time and increment your quotient by 10 until the result is less than 50, and then switch to subtracting by 5s and incrementing by 1 as before. If you can see why that works, then you realize it would be even faster to subtract by 500 at a time and increment by 100, then switch to subtracting 50 at a time and increment by 10, then subtract 5 at a time and increment by 1. Etc.So rather than minimizing the amount of digit copying, it would be better at first to write everything out. In this particular case - write the dividend 76543- remove groups of 50000. we can see we can subtract 50000 from this once the leading digit of the quotient is 1- write 50000 150000 under the 76543- subtract, writing 26543 this is the current remainder - remove groups of 5000. now we see we can subtract 25000 from this, so the next digit of the quotient is 5.- write 25000 55000 under the 26543- subtract, writing 1543 current remainder - remove groups of 500. 500 goes into that 3 times, so the next digit of the quotient is 3- write 1500 3500 under 1543- subtract, writing 43 current remainder - remove groups of 50. it is larger than the current remainder, so the next digit of the quotient is 0.- remove groups of 5. 5 goes into 43 eight times, so the next quotient digit is 8- write 40 85 under the 43- subtract. the final remainder is 3.The sequence of quotient digits was 15308.The standard way long division is taught, the child skips writing down all the digits of the remainder and it is confusing as to why this all works.
2023-07-04 18:50:44.000	I don t like this reasoning because I ve seen the inside of google. Their bandwidth is very cheap.What costs is having a CDN, a bunch of very fast servers that exist in every point-of-presence, given the load they endure CDN cache servers fail quickly when compared to others. -- along with the upkeep of their networking equipment, which is cheap but not free.But Google itself has invested wisely in how it connects to the internet, they are dark fibre all the way with many hundreds of gigabits between sites and pops. It s a huge upfront investment the kind SV startups seem to hate but the long tail makes bandwidth essentially free.The only cost they have is hardware and peering, and given their size I can t convince myself if they are or are not being shafted financially by big ISPs for peering - even if they are though, it s marginal compared to what GCP AWS etc charge us, even Colo datacenters will charge significantly more than what it costs Google.

FAA estimates are without inserting a passenger jet risks a fuel tank explosion every 60M hours, or roughly every 30,000 years. Lastly, it s unclear how well the FAA inerting requirements will even work, they only reduce oxygen levels to 12 , while military jets require 9 to eliminate explosion risks.It s silly to spend a large amount of money to retrofit planes near the end of their useful lives with safety equipment of questionable benefit. Especially when every bit of equipment introduces it s own new risks.
2014-08-20 16:54:26.000	What the article does not mention is, that in Germany every email provider with more than 10.000 customers is by law TKÜV required to install technical equipment, that enables authorities to access all stored telecommunication data of a person put under surveillance. The access happens automatic and does not require further interaction with staff of the email provider.It is even worse, as the same law extends to internet providers as well. Some people argue that this effectively is a government controlled man-in-the-middle infrastructure.

As such, they have little incentive to moveAnd apparently, little incentive to improve their city and environment. What the wealthy need to realize is that human nature is hard wired to notice relative wealth inequality. Crime and social unrest are directly related to perceptions of relative wealth inequality. Past a certain point, life expectancy is directly correlated with relative wealth inequality, not absolute wealth. b Ichiro Kawachi, 2000. Income Inequality and Health. In Social Epidemiology. Eds.

In Eich s case, what he did happened 6 years ago, and with no intention of making it public. In this case, he s openly telling juvenille jokes in an environment with a hightened intolerance to this kind of rhetoric and behavior.After enough of these cases happen, it just gets to the point where if you don t realize the need to censor yourself, then you are not a very smart person. I, for one, am encrypting all of my communication from here out, and only telling tasteless jokes with close, trusted friends. It s sad, but you have to ask yourself if it s more important to run a major company, or have the freedom to tell tasteless jokes. One of the reasons why running a startup sounds less attractive to me by the week.

2017-06-27 12:17:18.000	My hope is that they provide an opt-in method to bundle in google services.I want google maps, youtube, shopping links, and largely view the search as a portal to the google platform. Removing this is removing a feature customers and the company wants, because other companies want to compete on individual products that may or may not be better while google is providing a platform with products you want integrated to simplify your life.I ll take simplicity, trust and reliability over a dozen disconnected services from different companies that I don t know what their motives are. I know googles motives, and as a user of their platform otherwise this service is exactly what I want.Ultimately my argument is if another company came along and did the exact same thing from the start integrated platform with search etc... no one would have an issue. the Issue is apparently google s existing search dominance. This is why i think it should be opt-in for users, and by default off. I don t think google is wrong for offering the service to users who want it, competitors have to provide a benefit or product that is so clearly better it offsets the benefits of a more integrated platform. That s the market competition, not the EU s role.

2015-06-28 03:42:10.000	OK, so it all makes sense now. You had a bad experience with one person so you use that as an excuse to generalize and become discriminatory toward humanity at large.How is that fundamentally different from, say, seeing a person of a certain race do something bad and drawing racist conclusions, or being dumped by a woman and concluding all women suck, or seeing one person of religion X do something shitty and concluding all billion or so people of that religion suck?In other words, you re falling into the same trap that racists and misogynists and homophobes and nationalists and others fall into across the entire world.To which I have just one thing to say put yourself in the other s shoes. Alright, so you d clearly never be a religious fanatic, so you can t relate to that. But what if it were race or gender or something else? Let s say you re a member of some nationality, in a new country, trying to make the best of life. Some other person in your community who s from the same country does something really really shitty. All of a sudden, everyone hates you too, your boss fires you, and no one will hire you because they just assume they know how you ll act. You never even get a chance to make your case. How would that feel?In other words, give people a fucking chance. If someone causes problems, deal with that individual. In your situation, I suppose the org should ve gotten rid of the toxic person faster. But don t you fucking dare start saying that everyone with characteristic X, Y or Z should never be hired at any job ever just because some particular person you used to know caused problems. That reflects on you and you only.
2024-06-19 23:17:25.000	Hey I think this is a great idea! In fact I am working on putting together something similar! The apps in the meetup space are so bad there is a lot of potential here for new platforms.It is interesting that both you and the comments are focused on event discovery. I am looking at it from a different angle. I am looking for a platform that can keep a calendar of events and rsvps for already-established small nonprofits and community groups - like book clubs, board meetings, local political groups, etc. In my opinion there are lot of social networks that are doing a decent job of event discovery out there as much as you can in our very fragmented world . The problem is organizing who is going to what without using Outlook, Google Calendar, etc. - also with better options for recurring events and notifications reminders, and something non-tech-savvy people can use.

2020-06-01 21:59:40.000	That could work in Massachusetts, Maryland or some other states with very low firearms ownership rates. I don t think it s fair to ask police to go out and police without at least letting them have at their discretion the same level of armament as the local law abiding citizens and holding them to the same standards when they do use force. Allowing a civilian police force to have things the local civilians can t have doesn t make sense IMO.What cops really need is more training to not shoot first and ask questions later. 18yo marines manning checkpoints in the middle east are expected to more or less hold their fire until they come under fire. Domestic police should be held to similiar standards.
2024-02-24 18:47:59.000	I agree with this perspective, in theory. Not liking how something is implemented is different than suggesting it isn t implemented. The real damning aspect of this is that criticism surrounding these decisions seems to result in the silencing of the critic. There are times where moderation and banning are necessary, such as when the critic resorts to name calling or trolling. Criticism can lead to more awareness which could lead to a better implementation down the pike, even if there s alot of headbutting in the process. Outright silencing the dissent is counterproductive.I also don t think reporting about being banned silenced for such criticism is perpetuating the drama toxicity of the community for the sake of it when it s a real world outcome.

You can keep raking in the benefits and cranking up throughput without a whole lot of thought.It s much more expensive and complex to take an erratic latency operation and bring it down by throwing on more resources. As far as I can tell, the normal design course is making sure all your major actions are either pure or idempotent allowing parallel and redundant! requests to be made... which is a large worthy, but large engineering effort, and then we re talking about scaling to 2x or more just so you can make that redundant-request thing your default behavior.

I m not sure why though. Like, I could understand that somebody coming to Rust from Java wouldn t know what memory safety means since it is essentially a solution to a problem that Java does not have. But most high-level languages do not protect you from data-races, so this is a problem that Rust does solve and one can run into in most widely-used programming languages e.g. in Java they are also called data-races .

2019-05-01 06:51:35.000	The most conservative scientific estimate that the Earth s temperature will rise 1 to 7 degrees in the next 30 years, said Brown. This quote seems suspicious. The only place I see it is in this AP article, as a quote from this one person, and from a bunch of denialist websites that link to this article. I couldn t find any original source for the number or any indication whether it is Fahrenheit or Centigrade, which of course makes a large difference. If the quote was from 1989 then it was presumably referring to the IPCC report of that year, for which Wikipedia quotes under BAU increase of global mean temperature during the 21st century of about 0.3 oC per decade with an uncertainty range of 0.2 to 0.5 oC per decade would be 0.6 to 1.5C over 30 years, or roughly 1F-3F. So the 7 degrees seems to be nothing to do with the IPCC report, and it is unclear where it comes from or even what unit it has, but since he is from NY it seems plausible that it is F rather than C . Perhaps he was misquoted? Or he was quoting extreme outer bounds of the probability distribution. Building a case of inaccuracy on one poorly attributed number seems excessive.In reality, temperature trends have tracked IPCC predictions remarkably closely, and that fact is far more significant than a single poorly attributed quote.

2019-02-11 21:56:18.000	I realize it- months don t really matter when we re talking about the survival of the human race. We have never produced a self-sustaining closed system. The space station, Biosphere 2, and not any of the other closed environments we have ever created managed to stay closed and succeed without outside intervention. We have invented nuclear energy, and then have chosen to not utilize it at scale. The other forms of electrical energy we have created are exactly the problem- we have now realized we were doomed the moment we built the first coal power stations and created this faustian bargain with our environment. We can grow tropical plants in Canada at a huge expense of energy and utilizing fertilizers produced by fossil fuels. This carbon-rich energy let us balloon our population so that now we can t just turn it off- we are stuck. It isn t hyperbole- the soil, the insects, and the marine life that sustain us are disappearing and we have no technology to survive without them.

2014-03-17 19:53:13.000	The trope of software as a highly abstract, intellectually demanding, nearly mathematical activity contributes to a myth of software development as a profession naturally dominated by males math is the subject of its own interlocking system of tropes, myths and stereotypes that paint it as a manly pursuit. That logic seems to be all backwards to me. Of course developing software is a highly abstract, intellectually demanding activity.

If your returns aren t good enough relative to other investments of similar risk because you opted to pay more in taxes, you may have a harder time attracting investments. That s the theory at least, and a pretty good one if you ask me. To ignore that is to basically ask for not only increased taxes, but increased cost of capital overall.

On the underside every screw has a little pictogram so you can easily tell which ones are needed to remove the keyboard versus the hard drive for example.You can enter a system s serial number at and it will tell you exactly which parts went into it. For example some systems may have exactly the same model number, but some are made with LG panels and some with Samsung. This will tell you exactly.Then they have hardware maintenance manuals at which show you exactly how to take the laptop apart and change repair parts.IMHO they have done an excellent job. They even design the keyboard and system so that fluid on the keyboard drains out the bottom. Note it isn t waterproof, just a good effort to ensure a minor spill doesn t destroy the machine. One example video is at the proof is in the pudding - a friend who managed to break one of her hinges was able to lookup the exact part, order it, take the machine apart and replace the hinge and put it all back together without any difficulties or guesswork.

Beyond Ubuntu, Snaps are known to work in Arch Linux, Debian, Gentoo, Fedora, openSUSE, Yocto, and OpenWRT. Snaps simply require a modern systemd and snapd daemons.

The usage pattern of computers is significantly different p2p services, background downloading, etc. so in order to be able to offer unlimited service for that usage pattern they need to increase their own limited bandwidth significantly.If you want true unlimited bandwidth using your full download speed 24 7 you would have to pay a order of magnitude more for the service.

Although I am not afraid to call 911 to notify them, before calling, I think thoroughly about doing so and evaluate the situation appropriately. The operators also ask questions, like is the object on the road, was there anyone in the car in the ditch, they ve already been notified, etc. Why does Apple get to play by different rules and operate more recklessly?From the article, none of the automated calls were an emergency situation. Humans don t react well to false positives, and over time, those calls will be handled with much less priority or attention.In the particular situation of skiing, they have their own patrols. I m not aware of endemic situations where people are injured but not discovered or helped.My issue is that Apple is using emergency services as the last mile implementation rather than handling it themselves.

Virtualization allows you to run Windows and Linux on the same server, 40 different C libraries with potentially incompatible ABIs, across X time zones and Y locales, and they ll all work.You can provide the same level of replication and separation of dependencies in an OS, but at a certain point you re just creating the same thing as a hypervisor and calling it an OS and the distinction becomes academic.

2022-06-10 01:25:37.000	what are commit signatures used for in the OSS community todayI d like to think that when a package maintainer for a Linux distro downloads the latest version of the code they are packaging, they check that all the commits are signed by the same developer IDs as last time.Okay, that s an over-simplification because you need to allow for key rotation, and new people joining the project, but that could be tractable or even automatable with a few heuristics and tools.For example, there could be a tool for checking if new keys were signed by previous keys with the same email address, and there could be a contributors.policy file which specifies who the project leaders are and how many of them are needed to sign off on a given release or commit.
2008-09-16 04:45:35.000	If you go by the dictionary, there s no difference between lobbying and corruption. Of course, there is also no difference between voting and corruption, which is the inherent problem of electoral democracy. The founders made a huge design flaw by not adopting the Venetian and Athenian system of using lotteries to select office holders. Read Nick Szabo on the subject Also, read the Rauch book I recommended before. Rauch worked for years for the National Journal, which is the magazine that ends up on the desk of every Congressional staffer. His description of how government really works matches my experiences in Washington perfectly.Lobbying works on two fronts. First, is the appeal to public welfare. In the 1980 s the interests in favor of creating Fannie Mae appealed to the dream of home ownership and the idea of making homes more affordable. They convinced Congress that a quasi-public company would make interest rates cheaper and housing more affordable in the short run this is true, since with implicit government backing, they could borrow more cheaply . Later in the 1990 s Fanne Mae convinced Congress that in the goal of opening up home ownership to more people, they should lower the down payment requirements. Again, there is the appeal to helping the poor achieve the American dream.Of course, the lobbyists are also looking out for their own self-interest. Lowering the down payment requirements would help them sell more loans and make more money. Perhaps the lobbyists were being cynical about the benefits to the poor. Or perhaps they believed their own marketing and genuinely believed it was win-win. It doesn t matter, the effect is the same.The second part of lobbying is the campaign contributions and the golf games. This provides the Congressman the personal incentive to support the lobbyists plan. Most of this happens right out in the open - the days of passing around suit cases full of cash are over although if you want to read about those times check out Caro s Master of the Senate . The amount of the contributions is not enormous, but in an election every bit helps. It s enough money that the Congressman will try to find away to help the lobbyist if he can.The end result is disastrous. By having the implicit government backing and by lowering the down payment requirements, Fannie Mae was able to make massive number of irresponsible loans Its managers made tens of millions. Then the whole thing crashed and the taxpayer is now footed with part of the bill. But no Congressman will pay any price for the debacle, so they never learn the lesson. Most voters won t even know who is responsible. And the general voting public has no ability to vote out the members of the banking committee - voters can only vote out the member of their own district. Of course the voters of that particular district don t want to vote their particular Congressman out. If they did, they would lose the earmarks that come from having a senior Congressman. Thus, there ends up being no accountability. Congress ends up with a 98 reelection rate and a 20 approval rating.For the Congressmen involved, it is just a case of good intentions gone awry. In fact, I actually think Congressmen genuinely believed they were doing the right thing when they created Fannie Mae. Righteousness has an amazing ability to align itself with self-interest.I find it amusing when people subscribe to the throw the bums out theory of politics. If you ve every worked in Washington, you realize that the people running the show are generally no worse than anyone else in the country. Most are pretty decent, a few are rotten. The real problem is the incentive structure of our current political system. The only solution to fixing Washington is major Constitutional reform.

2019-03-12 10:06:49.000	It s a great and important article but feedback should not be overpushed. I agree that opting out is a way to go but mandatory feedback one-on-ones The expectation that I set is, either you come to me with a difficult conversation, or I ll come to you with one. this can easily be taken too far at least if we re talking about IT communities. I found that encouraged open hours do work very well but you need to assure that each conversation will remain absolutely in strict confidence. Retrospectives work very well too to identify what problems cause team underperformance. And 360 reviews so far showed highest results done once every three months, each team member had time to rethink their behavior, - what s good and where to improve. So far one-on-ones were pretty stressful but that might be the specifics of the company I work in. Overall this is a great article and feedback culture is very important, thank you.

2020-02-12 15:25:47.000	Mixcloud is great however the people in charge seem to be intent on killing the platform with bad ideas. I say this as a huge fan and a paying customer premium user .The android app is horrible. They used to have 10-30 minutes of cache time, now they have 0. You go under a tunnel, on the tube, whatever, and your stream cuts out. Also lots of UI bugs. This might have gotten better but I wouldn t know as I am on an older version of the app and refuse to upgrade due to no more caching.You have to pay to rewind stuff apparently I do pay so have never been impacted here Search is horrible, even now.Web has some major bugs like randomly reloading half the page when you scroll down your feed and click listen to something. Old app has some ridiculous UI bugs, can t comment on the newer ones though.Mixcloud select may have been done with the best intentions, but it s just a bunk idea. Half of my feed is now select stuff I can t listen to. The idea is you pay the individual artist and get premium features. But the select costs a fair bit of money, a lot more than id be willing to pay. Effectively, even as a paying user I m now being paywalled. They should have kept the stuff free and heavily integrated with patreon or done a tipping style platform.Sorry for the long rant but I figure this is a chance to actually have someone from team mixcloud potentially read some actual feedback that they re probably sheltered from normally.

2022-01-18 09:29:05.000	I kind of agree with you, but just because it creates a precedent. If Blizzard allows a political statement, then now they have to allow other political statements too. As a result, they will have to regulate which political statements is allowed or denied, which will force them in a position of having to judge about what is wrong and what is right. And what corporation wants to do that?Not all political statements are black or white , right or wrong Manichaeism style , and there are a lot of gray areas sometimes, and everybody has something to complain about on Twitter. And if Blizzard decides wrong then they may suffer and repair the backslash.So the reaction from Blizzard is like the sign you used to see in a lot of bars No politics, no religion .Understand I m not saying that the player is wrong about what he said, or justifying what happens in HK.

And as only 1 10,750 of the carbon remains from the plants that were buried millions of years ago, our one litre of petrol is the result of 1.1 x 10,750 11,825 kg of carbon from ancient plants. Finally, as plants are approximately half carbon, that means that 23.65 tonnes of plants were required to make just one litre of the petrol available at your local station Wow, and this is a lower bound because it doesn t even consider manufacturing and distribution.My cognitive dissonance at the gas station is approaching an all-time high.

Any form of separation between form content requires external tools that need upkeep.For example, if you use Wordpress, you ll have to keep updating WP because of security risks, but then you ll also have to keep adapting your templates to keep up with the changes in WP.However, once you no longer need to update the site and simple want to display its contents, you can fix it in time by crawling the website, in much the same way that the Archive team is doing now. You end up with a collection of HTML files that you can host with ease and minimal maintenance. If you do it properly , you turn off commenting beforehand so you don t end up with non-functioning links, and you create an .htaccess that makes sure the old dynamic urls get correctly mapped to your new static files.I ve done this, it s not rocket science, it s not unreasonable to ask this from Amazon, and I wish it was standard practice for sunset websites.

Given that anyone with a credit card can already achieve robust multi-region deployments, it doesn t seem hard for an ASI to make itself very hard to turn off .Alternatively an ASI can ally with a group of humans to whom it can credibly promise wealth and power.

2015-10-05 00:42:11.000	It s easier to answer in reverse businesses escape fierce competition the normal state in a competitive marketplace if they have -1 Trade secrets, such as aluminum casting if I recall correctly for Musk and SpaceX, and Intel s tempering of memory chips in the early days.2 Patents - when others can reverse engineer what you ve done, you don t have the option of 1 . Copyrights, somewhat similar and can be a part of tech products in the US code, etc. 3 Network effect high cost of entry. Most likely when monopoly and competition laws are poorly enforced, as is often true in new fields. But disruption is a possibility.4 Law corruption. More common than thought. The EU thinks the US is simply ignoring antitrust laws re its large companies such as Google anything free can count as bundling , for example. Interoperability isn t even on Facebook s radar. This can take a fairly soft form EU laws forbid wines from outside a given region being called by the famous name such as Champagne and may soon forbid overseas data storage or passage too. Security laws in China, re tech products, will likely restrict foreign competition there in the long run. Amazon is being allowed to in effect enforce ebook prices of at least 3 with no action from the justice department, leveraging that policy to gain exclusive access to large numbers of books if they want any free days. Strictly illegal, but it s just not in the US interest to go after their own Hegemonic corporations. So ebook distribution, the most obvious of commodity services... turns out not to be a commodity at all, somehow given Justice department inaction.There are other temporary causes, such as a shortage of workers with particular knowledge or skills coders just now. Well, here s hoping that s temporary.Refusing to participate in a race to the bottom in quality say, and taking a hit for a while can also leave a company without obvious competition for a time.I ve left out cornered markets on minerals, not too likely at the moment.One could also add patent pooling, which US automotive companies used both to save on research and raise the cost of entry, in the short run in order to create an oligopoly.
2021-06-18 20:52:57.000	Not sure what techniques exactly you re referring to, but the commonly used techniques for GPS enhancement e.g. RTK 1 are not simple distance measurements between GPS receivers and base stations but rather both stations measuring the satellite signal and using the difference of the signal in both locations to improve position estimates.I imagine it s possible to set up a ground-based network, but you would need a high density to cover large surfaces you want to see at least four stations from every position . I also imagine that it would be difficult to get accurate vertical positions if the stations are all in the same horizontal plane. 1

2021-12-14 14:51:54.000	I don t know why OP described SQL NULLs as three-valued logic because it s anything but.SQL boolean operators can only result true or false, there isn t a third option.NULL is a data value for all data types, which happens to return true to the boolean operation is null , and false to any other boolean operation. NULL NULL or NULL 1 don t return a third-option NULL, there is no such thing, they return a plain old false . NULL NULL returns false because otherwise it would make outer joins terrible As you pointed out, SQL does not implicitly convert boolean values bits to or from the result value of boolean operators. Bits are values and can be NULL. Boolean results are not values and can only be true or false.Now, is this optimal? Hell no. Sum types would probably be the way to go if SQL were designed 50 years later. But it s consistent.

My original point was that this doesn t matter anyway - if their good presentation highlights a point, that s awesome. These people all know how to connect dots in an interesting way and then relay these ideas. They are for the most part not coming up with wildly new concepts and inventions pg s founding of Viaweb being a good exception to this, of course! For what it s worth, a lot of people have good ideas and write them down. Many of these people go unheralded. This makes those I mentioned successful idea spreaders in my book.Which is way more difficult and valuable than being able to work the lab equipment and run statistical tests afterward.Since the insights people have often depend on the hard and boring science and studies to be completed, that strikes me as an odd or perhaps it was satirical? statement. Without the lab equipment and statistical tests there would be few new confirmed discoveries for us to make these connective insights about -

The thing many founders struggle to comprehend when taking on outside capital is that there comes a point fairly early on when it s not really your company anymore you just work for it as a minority shareholder.The other investors have a fiduciary duty to their own stakeholders that generally comes before the founder s desire for special treatment. Good founders that know they re not the right ones to lead the next phase of the business know when to step aside. Founders that don t and try to cling on when they ve long passed the threshold of their own competence to lead aren t doing anyone favors by trying to cling on.
2019-12-11 21:37:08.000	Hand-rolling is unnecessary and error-prone. It is better to leverage the compiler.There are a couple relevant GCC flags -mcpu and -mtune. The -mcpu flag will specify which features it is allowed to assume are present. The blog post is using SSE instructions, I m thinking SSE2 but that s just from memory, and these days most people consider it eccentric to try and support CPUs without SSE2.There are a couple ways you can do the feature testing in your own program. You can make multiple copies of the function and compile them with different CPU targets, and then use something like void xor512a_avx ... __attribute__ target avx ... if __builtin_cpu_supports avx xor512a_avx dst, src Alternatively, you can use something called function multiversioning, which will write the branch for you. I think this feature is present in both GCC and Clang.Also note that there are some unusual edge cases you may not have considered with feature detection. There s a strong case to say that instructions like CPUID are the wrong way to go about it, and you should do things like use sysctl on macOS. The risks in using CPUID are a bit esoteric in my opinion, though.

Have you heard of wasm for example? Quite interesting, what you can do with that. And a bit more sophisticated, than scratching together some html markup.But I very much agree, though, that I also don t want any website to have deeper access to my hardware, without explicit consent from myself. Until there s a proper open standard for web technology apps that are opt-in and user initiated, and clearly separated visually and technically from web pages which are documents I feel like Apple are on my side here. So yes, there is more work needed in that area to make that distinction more clear to the users.But I don t see Apple is pushing in that direction. Rather the opposite. Pushing into their walled garden, they control. Otherwise they would be very free and able to polish their PWA permission dialogs, to protect their users, no?What is hindering them?

2010-12-16 23:14:18.000	I think Scott needs to re-engineer his idea virus, it s not quite on the mark. Ultimately, it will only ever at best end up as a famous quote like Give peace a chance for similar mentioned reasons, but also because the virus doesn t offer immediacy. It s not something that an individual whose been infected with the virus can act on, rather it s something that will ultimately require collective action on. To be more power, Scott should revise the idea virus such that the transfered idea is something simple, and can be taken on by an individual that will ultimately lead to the end of war.I ll leave the revision to Scott himself, but I will offer an example.For instance, if my goal is to ultimately solve cancer A simple catchy saying Donate 1 today, Write it off Tomorrow -IRS. .The idea is catchy because it implies personal benefit as a direct compensation. Writing it off , hell every one wants a way to reduce how much money gets sucked up by taxes every year. To imply that being generous, we can alleviate some of our tax woes, the idea gains traction with people. Of course, the truth is you need a certain net amount of donations to really write it off, and even if you do, you don t gain any money you simply choose where it is spent--the over all net result is still a loss. But that simple matter isn t caught by those rational filters.Obviously, the idea doesn t constrain what is donated to and as such could be donated to some opensource project not even related to cancer research. Nor would a single dollar donation likely benefit any cause, much less cancer research. However the net effect of the idea, is an overall increase in charitable giving. More money is given, by more people, as the idea spread. The best part about the idea is the immediate positive feedback. Unlike Scott s initial Education is the antidote of war , an idea like Donate 1 today, write it off tomorrow is more likely to spread and achieve it s ultimate goal.I think Scott should revise his approach by simply adding a fourth trait An idea virus must be actionable on the individual level.
2015-10-19 16:32:53.000	Regarding sharing employee evaluations, two things if you go on the record with press discussing your evaluation and says it says one thing, but it actually says another, I think the company is entitled to respond.

Obviously there s a long quote from Dina Vaccari contradicting the reporting.As to sharing the reason an employee resigned from the the company, I don t think an employee s conduct while at a company is confidential, and if they are a strongly biased source, then the NYT needs to know that, and then adjust their reporting accordingly.

2019-04-07 11:26:07.000	The 1.6 gigawatt Olkiluoto 3 EPR has cost 5.5 billion and the building has taken 14 years so far it s not ready yet . And this is happening in a high functioning low corruption country.The lightbulb wasn t the real invention - it was the lightbulb making machine that had the real impact on the world.The same way, we need a way to safely, quickly and cheaply build and operate nuclear power plants. The way might be small modular reactors, something like 200 megawatt sized. They can be built in well controlled circumstances in a factory. Installation on site should be fast. Currently, a nuclear power plant construction requires lots of welding and concrete casting. In these projects it is slow and expensive because of extra safety needs and regulations. On site construction should be minimized instead.One could run multiple smaller reactors in one site so safety areas would not be greatly increased. Emergency and maintenance shutdowns would have smaller impact on the grid than currently with multiple gigawatt sizes.With smaller reactors, innovation and experimentation should also be a lot faster. If you build one reactor every 20 years, you don t get a lot of incremental innovation.

That assistant is going to power down on its own as soon as it things you re not steering anymore. Which often happens without reason just driving straight .Basically that thing is only working if you hold the steering wheel like a 50 s 60 s Hollywood star, turning left and right on a dead straight street. Maybe the next incarnation will improve this design..

The farmer nods, so the city slicker opens his laptop, calls up some satellite photos, runs some algorithms, and announces, You have 1,432 sheep. Impressed, the farmer says, You re right. Go ahead and take one. So the city slicker loads one of the animals into the backseat of the car. Now, says the farmer, I ll bet all my sheep against your car that I can tell you what you do for a living. A gaming sort, the city slicker says, Sure. You re a consultant, says the farmer. Wow! says the consultant. How d you know? Well, says the farmer, you come from nowhere even though I never asked you to. You drive a flash car, and waer a smart suit. You told me something I already knew. And you don t know anything about my business. Now give me back my dog.

2018-04-23 17:48:05.000	Your math ignored both maintenance and property tax on the home. Let s say maintenance costs 1 a year and property tax is 3.5 a year. I m choosing both numbers lower than likely reality to give your position an advantage and let s say that advantage covers any income tax benefit of paying the property tax. After those 30 years you have a 1214 asset that you ve put a bit over 1170 into - that s the original 100 plus about 238 in maintenance and about 833 in property taxes. So your 100 investment has grown by about 44 while the stock investment in your example, after deducting 20 in cap gains, has grown by about 114.The house by itself is a bad investment, factoring in mortgage interest makes it even worse, then factoring in not paying rent makes it significantly better. How much worse or better it is in the final analysis depends on factors that are outside of many our controls - jobs, family, local market, etc. The decision is not quite as cut dry as many on this thread make it out to be.

The diagnosis helped her to understand that it s just a very concrete thing that she has that affects one aspect of her functioning, and doesn t mean that she s dumb, or lazy, or whatever other story she had ended up telling herself. We are homeschooling her, and it also helped us to understand what was going on for her, and to adapt how we teach her appropriately.

It used so little energy to stay above freezing that they demonstrated at 40 below the whole place could sustain its temperature using a single candle. Very impressive, I do wonder how in a box that airtight you re going to get rid of moisture and what they did to manage the humidity in the spaces between the three walls.The big trick that I understood they used was to make smaller vertical boxes and to use reflective foil on the outer wall side to radiate heat back in.

This has historically resulted in either ignoring errors from sub-functions, because their error return type don t map properly, or returning generic i got an error without any more information about what the error was.And all this was historically patched over by having verbose log files that could be written to from anywhere and the user had to peruse and try to make sense of after the fact.Some franework tried to create complicated error code like Windows COM but in the end there is no free lunch.

2022-10-12 18:10:40.000	One of the main challenges of these VR headsets is the time-to-start for any activity. It s just atrocious.If someone invites me to an impromptu Zoom call today, I can join it quickly and easily, because it s likely I was already on my computer. I see the link on my computer, usually in my calendar or in Slack. It takes me a second to click it. And boom, I m in. Ezpz.Compare that to a VR meeting. If someone invites me, I m likely on my computer. I have to leave my computer, go find my headset because it s bulky and inconvenient to keep on my desk, hope that it s charged which 50 of the time it s not, boot it up which takes 10 seconds, clear a safe space for me to stand in my apartment, put on the headset and draw a safety boundary, open the appropriate app and hope it doesn t need an update, and then try to figure out where the hell the invite link is that was chatted Slacked texted calendar d to me.The difference between jumping into something in 5 seconds vs 5 minutes seems trivial, but it s massive. It ends up being the difference between me doing this 5x a week vs 5x a year.What VR seems to need are more killer apps that are habitual, so I use the headset more often, so it s close by it s charged I keep an open space occasionally I m already using it when I get an invite to use it in some other way. There are all sorts of things that I regularly do on my computer, that I could potentially do better in VR if an app existed, but none does.
2021-06-05 06:10:50.000	The simplest description I ve found is at which also provides a couple of examples.Basically, you start a coprocess using the operator somecommand This starts somecommand asynchronously, with stdin and stdout attached to anonymous pipes with descriptor numbers that can be referenced by a literal descriptor name, p . So running cat p will shuttle the output of the somecommand coprocess to stdout. p always references the most recently created coprocess, so to juggle multiple coprocesses you have to dup p to explicit descriptors exec 4 p somecommand2 5 p That s not as great as having named references, but it s rare to need to independently juggle more than 1 or 2 coprocesses from the same context. You re almost always plugging them together in series or in a complex graph using subshells. In either case you re only needing to manage the same few descriptor constants. It s sort of like writing in a stack-based language, where you really only use explicit references to the top of the stack.coprocesses provide a simple construct for cases where you would otherwise have to manually create a named pipe using mkfifo. The need for this pattern comes up surprisingly often, IME, yet because it s so messy--now you need to worry about tmp races, cleaning things up, etc--people rarely bother, myself included. From the perspective of a shell it s a relatively simple construct to implement. The semantic benefit cost ratio is exceptional.This basic functionality is complemented with extension options to the read and print non-standard builtins -p reads from or writes to the latest coprocess, and -u the specified descriptor number. I haven t used coprocesses much because I can t rely on them, but I don t think these are strictly needed. Maybe they were required for proper buffering in early implementations or even current ones , where redirection to and from builtins didn t utilize the same buffered I O context? That seems more like an implementation detail.ksh93, bash, and some other shells provide the process substitution construct, traditional Unix shell model, and would round it out. Of course, the sky is the limit for evolving the Unix shell model in new directions, as Oil has shown. ksh88 had coprocesses so I m curious why it wasn t included in POSIX Maybe because bash lacked an implementation? Or incompatible quirks between ksh88 and ksh93 related to stdout inheritance across coprocesses?

2023-04-02 00:04:10.000	I have implemented a JSON-like CRDT using this nice tutorial 1 , which is a tree, but never an append-only DAG.I m curious how two edges meeting the same vertex will make it difficult to resolve the conflict automatically? Is it that two users will create the same vertex concurrently with slightly different attributes, and attribute-merging requires human-in-the-loop?Of course if the DAG is not append-only, but supports, say, moving of edges branches, it is a totally different problem. Martin has something to say about this 2 . 1 2
2022-02-17 01:57:57.000	Me too. The app startup times in particular make it a pain. And the pollution of the mount table and worse integration an annoyance.I still use it for servers as everything I use is available in apt anyway. But some desktop packages are only in snaps now.
2014-05-31 23:08:53.000	This reminds me of programming something from A. K. Dewdney s Armchair Universe on my Amiga in the late 80s. I think it originally appeared in Scientific American. It started off with bugs that just sort of juggled, but the ones that survived eventually glided around eating things.
2024-03-25 13:48:14.000	Presumably they were just giving an example. The huge spike in German energy costs absolutely did push manufacturers to find ways to be more energy efficient in a very similar way it pushed regular consumers to also be more conscious of their energy use.

2024-05-13 08:58:24.000	Sounds good! I might go even further and just use a custom address for each service, i.e. paypal example.com or something.Which is exactly what I do. As soon as I see spam sent to any particular email address, I know who it is that leaked the address and I can block it without issue. But self-hosting email is an adventure I m nervous to embark on.Why are you nervous about it? I ve been doing so for decades and haven t had many issues at all. There are a bunch of all-in-one solutions like mailinabox 0 I roll my own, but as I said, I ve been doing this for decades and others which would likely make things simpler for you. Go for it! You won t be disappointed. 0
2012-03-09 20:51:12.000	Interestingly a YC company with no tech co-founders, the team looks like one Business Analyst from the real estate sector, one ex-quant from Goldman Sachs and one ex-McKinsey consultant.Does this reflect a shift in the type of applicants YC is accepting ? - It d be interesting to know how far along they were before they applied to YC.As for the startup itself, I think they re making the mistake that other startups in the same space are making at least from my experience in hiring at investment banks in that they re presenting themselves as an alternative to CVs.Pre-recorded video interviews, etc. are way too time consuming compared to CVs to be the first stage in candidate screening. I think the post-CV screening and pre-interview stage is probably the most effective place for this type of solution to live.

2015-11-06 18:20:56.000	It s not just the acoustic properties of dynamic-compressed music. The compression forces music to be more simplistic, because there s less room for complexity. Michael Jackson s Thriller is a standard pop hit, engineered for chart performance and not artistic virtuosity, but it is still a rich, deep, satisfying piece of music to listen to in part because there s a whole lot of stuff going on. If you tried to cram that many instrument parts into a modern Katy Perry tune, it would clip like crazy and become unlistenable hash.
2016-06-26 21:36:27.000	what do you hope to gain by talking to them?I m assuming that by capital A, versus lowercase a atheists, you are trying to underscore the differences between people who understand that religion is a hoax but it doesn t affect me right now so I ll let it pass, and those who have been directly affected by religion and it s evils and see no other way but to fight it as hard as they push it?I will try to explain why this is bad engaging the mentally ill in their delusions is not only mean you don t believe their crazy stories, so why listen to them? it s bad for society as a whole, because this is a untreated mental illness that is totally treatable and it s being spread because people refuse to treat it as a mental illness and instead say, believe what you want.why is it bad to allow the masses to remain ignorant?you hopefully wouldn t teach your children that the world is flat, because you were educated against such teachings.you wouldn t teach a medical student about the human body without allowing them to learn about the human body by cutting it open and studying it.you wouldn t let your neighbor spray your yard with ddt hopefully because a higher being told him it was safe.you wouldn t take advice from someone on the Internet without first researching the topic we all do yet we ll freely entertain the insanity of religion because why? so many people believe it?we all thought the world was flat, the human body was designed by God and shouldn t be examined, sprayed ddt right in our children s faces, and still take advice from strangers on the Internet without doing research because, we re sheep hanlons razor .it s all stupidity, and fear. we re all alone, there is no guidebook and we re so painfully self aware.when you have No explanation, any explanation seems possible.the world is not flat, but knowing we knew, was comforting.anyways, what was I trying to get at?don t let them in. keep them very far away from you.if you want to help change the world, be proactive. openly challenge religious beliefs any time they are presented. it could get you killed. it will get you beaten.but we all have a duty to further the human species, and putting us second to imaginary beings is not exactly the way to go about it IMO.
2021-01-19 20:07:58.000	One side is BS, that s why. That is the side which is whining about how an app that was created in order to provide a safe haven for people who are too extreme for other platforms is being treated different from those other platforms.
2009-10-21 08:30:02.000	Voting is like innoculation.I do not merely vote for a mainstream candidate to ensure that my choice gets in. I also vote so that extreme candidates are excluded. A vote for a mainstream candidate is an innoculation for society against extremist diseases.It is vanishingly unlikely that my vote will be at the exact tipping point, ie a hanging chad county in Florida. It is also unlikely that my innoculation against killer flu will be the one innocluation that stops the spread of the virus. But from society s point of view it does not matter - the more who are innoculated, the safer society is.Similarly, the more people who vote the more candidates need to pander to the mainstream opinion, not the extremist. In general we become safer.This all breaks down if mainstream opinion is actually wrong . But thats a different issue.PSHere in the UK the fascist BNP have got two MEPs and will be controversially appearing on a wellknown politics talk show. Innoculations need to be kept up.
2021-06-15 14:15:32.000	I ve been on and off Vyvanse and Ritalin for a decade. Work with your doctor on side effects, I found Concerta to have the least side effects for me long-lasting, tapers slowly at end of day, and fewer anxious feelings for me than Vyvanse. I ve also taken breaks from the medication for a year or more. It takes somewhere between 3 days and 3 weeks to feel like I m not missing something when I stop the medication, but overall it s not that bothersome or unpleasant unless work life is very busy at that time. Quitting coffee cold-turkey feels much worse, for comparison.

That State law you are referring to was passed long after this battle was underway, and I can tell you that companies definitely denied that the law existed, said it was unfair, and also paid lawyers to write contracts that tried to take employee IP anyway, and use sales tactics on new employees to accept it.

2022-12-05 15:43:24.000	Well another AI model created by Stability.ai called Dance Diffusion 0 wasn t widely reported with all the fanfare and that was deliberately trained on public domain data , Creative Commons-licensed data and data contributed by artists in the community. which is opt-in. A further perspective is that stable diffusion may have been trained on copyrighted images in the first place even though it may not exactly reproduce an image in it s training corpus.Given that watermarked copyrighted images sometimes come up in the outputs, I m sure that is the case. Had that been trained on copyrighted music, the whole company would be sued to the ground and the model would never be released without permission or no attribution.So for StabilityAI, it is fine to break the copyright of digital artists and use their work without their permission, but not fine to do the same to copyrighted musicians and artists and instead generate music from public domain sources. I m sure voice cloning requires permission from the person as well otherwise there would be more legal issues.The same goes for Copilot training on AGPL code outside of GitHub including StackOverflow, etc. but IANAL. 0

2017-04-07 02:27:35.000	Ubuntu has always been focused on the GNOME platform - they started with the GNOME environment and Unity itself is an alternate shell for GNOME desktop. GNOME is going to be much more familiar to their developers and users - users will use the exact same applications they d use in Unity and they will look good and make sense. KDE is really an alternate universe, and one I enjoy and prefer for now but I don t thing this would make sense for Ubuntu. If you want a KDE-focused distribution based on Ubuntu, KDE Neon looks awesome.

2016-11-05 22:43:58.000	It s a huge difference. As someone who s lived in the UK before paying 1500 for a computer is a lot. A good software engineer salary in London is 60k a year, with only really good salaries going significantly beyond that I ve heard of quants and super senior people making 100k, but that s the exception not the norm. That means that, if you live in the Bay Area and make a reasonable 120k, you are basically paying double for your Mac in London.I recall at some point, some software prices like the full Adobe suite were so inflated in the UK that it was cheaper to fly to New York, spend a couple days there, and buy the licenses there, than it did to buy them in the UK.We as in, us living in the Bay Area and the US in general live in a bubble where the iPhone is barely more expensive than other phones and Macs, while expensive, are still comfortably within our reach because our salaries are way above average.

2017-11-03 12:49:57.000	Does this electricity charge a battery pack, which then is used to drive the electric motors which turn the screws? This would imply that the heat generation and turbine spin-up time merely need to respond before the batteries are discharged, potentially allowing response times of minutes or hours. It would give Tesla-like instant throttle response, where the operator would move the lever and the sub would jump forward.Or does it directly power the engines? This would mean that your entire control loop would include the latency of the steam generation process. Move the lever, wait for the water to get hot, wait for the turbines to spin up, and then the screws would start to turn faster. Like the throttle response in an ancient diesel truck.Given that the original diesel submarines used giant battery arrays to power the electric motors while the engines were off, and that the former gives much better control response, I d assume that there are still large batteries in the loop. This paper 2 supports that assertion The nominal cell voltage is 2.0 V. 1 The PDX-57 cell designed for Ohio-class submarines weights 2,100 pounds with a capacity of more than 10,000 Amp-hours and stored energy of 2.6 MWh. 1 The ASB-49 cell designed for the Los Angeles-class submarine weights 1,300 pounds with a capacity of 7,200 Amp-hours and stored energy of 1.8 MWh. 1 The LLL-69 type cell weights 1,500 pounds with a capacity of 8,100 Amp- hours and stored energy of 2.0 MHh. 1 A couple megawatthours is plenty to run the screws while the steam loop and nuclear reactor respond.Therefore, toomanybeersies comment On a nuclear powered ship, yes, since you still essentially have a steam engine, the engine telegraph throttle isn t actually linked directly to the engine.is technically correct but actually irrelevant. The nuclear reactor telegraph does control the steam turbine and eventually the battery charge, rather than the engine. But somewhere there s an electric motor controller which responds instantly. 1 2
2018-08-19 08:25:18.000	Becoming a millionaire is harder, yes, but so is also crash down to poverty. Safety nets such as cheap free education, free healthcare, public retirement funds, more protective labor laws and such make it easier for everybody to avoid falling and or getting out of poverty when times are bad. Your example of putting 3-4 months of US paychecks only work if you get paid a lot already, but not if you re poor or have high expenses kids through college, medical costs . The social agreement in Europe appears to be that it is more depressing to see people losing everything to market forces , and that letting people become millionaires in years is not a priority at all.

It s soothing for the fragile Western conservative ego, but it s just not true - not, at least, with regards to space.The failure of the N1 program was a leadership issue, period. Just like America trailing the Russians at first was a leadership and lack of focus issue. One team kept winning, then they lost their captains and their funding. Meanwhile, the other team got great leaders and awesome sponsors and started busting their collective ass really hard around the same time - and the wheel of fortune suddenly turned. Funny how that works, isn t it?What s strange is that the true events sound a heck of a lot more american work hard and reap the laurels, or slack off and be a loser and yet you keep hearing the same bullshit all the time as to how the Russian stuff was just inferior . It s not true. And it s not a good story to tell your kids.

2019-11-14 00:06:03.000	It s not science. Human brains are very recent in evolutionary terms. What a frog or a peacock does is a result of many orders of magnitude more time under natural selection than the age of modern humans. People guess that this or that behavior is because of natural sexual selection and pass it off as science with no proof just because the word evolution was mentioned. It takes a very long time for something to become an instinct. Given how much human brains are capable of, I just think the most Occam s razor answer is culture and mimicry rather than somehow some uniquely human behavior having been important enough to survival to become an instinct across the board.

2016-03-22 10:26:48.000	Some of the things off the top of my head in no particular order protocols, closer to traits than interfaces , Optional types, elsewhere no null types , pattern matching if let, case let , guards, so you can cover your preconditions nicely , immutable let bindings first, var variables second, with mutability being tied to the binding outsite of reference types classes , tuples, lazy evaluation, flexible closure syntax, fairly powerful type inference, enums as tagged unions, or as standard C enums if you want , extensions - even for core structures if you need it - straighforward way to define custom or overload existing operators, type system powerful enough to be able to implement a fairly convincing Functor, Applicative or Monad without much effort, structs AND classes, most things are value types...But most importantly to me, Swift is composed in such a way that it just clicks for me, ie many times many times I can guess how something is likely called or how it will behave without looking at the docs and I have a solid chance of being right - that intuitiveness is something that is lacking in many other languages I ve used over the years.In regards to C , by now it is definitely not just a Java clone anymore, in particular saner type system and much more functional features edge it for me over Java, plus the speed of evolution is much greater in the C land. If you want to see how C and Java differ but are tied to the JVM, try Kotlin - it s fairly similar in feel to C and has 100 Java compatibility.

Cool, just finished Days Gone and i m replaying BioShock. I don t want to do programming anymore. You re just burned out and depressed, find a therapist, take medicine, etc. . Did that. I m on Welbutrin and my therapist says I should look into changing fields, maybe going back to school. Easy right? I don t want to do programming anymore. It s all mental, meditate . I sit outside on my deck every weekend and just enjoy the outdoors. I still don t want to write programs. Buy a motorcycle . I already have one and I love it, but I still don t want to write programs.After many years of feeling this way and getting the answers like the above, any answer not in the realm of you can move to X field with relative ease and maintain the same salary benefits doesn t feel like it s going to help. It seems my only option is to just accept defeat

2010-06-04 17:04:39.000	I m shooting from the hip here, but I think maybe there s a distinction to be made between ideas for a product and ideas as a product. The end result of the ideas of mathematicians is mathematics itself - furthering mathematics was the goal all along. Obviously ideas count when you re working within the realm of ideas alone. However, when the ideas are a means to an end e.g., a movie, say , the implementation is what counts. You might have the world s greatest screenplay in your desk, but if you haven t gotten to the execution stage, what kind of movie do you have? None. Whereas if you d started with something, anything, like walking trees fighting hobgoblins, say, or the idea that maybe humans are just batteries for supercomputers in the future, your movie might have a chance, depending on its execution.

2020-07-07 13:30:01.000	I find it hard to reason about text which contains stylistic assumptions which are quite handwavy, such as which is opaque, hard to reason about, and can encourage some lazy programming habits.In the same handwaving vein to me it is not opaque and does not encourage lazy programming habits. Having to return err is no different to raising an exception except that you do not do stack unwinding, but it does force you to write more code because the language designers have decided that dealing with every possible error, inline, using conditionals, is way more important to them than making the happy path of the algorithm readable as one unit of prose.To me there is no difference in outcome when the happy path is written out first, and then the possible failure conditions are enumerated. It can be accomplished with sum types, but it can also be accomplished by matching on exception types.The difficult part about Go s errors is that they are neither. For example, if you want a backtrace congratulations, you have to use errors and wrap every single error you receive from your callees. You want to accumulate the causes of an error and pass it up? Well you better hope that your callees already have stored this metadata for you. The error is in net http internalpkgoranother ? Bad luck, as it surely won t be wrapping for you. So some essential metadata is missing. Want to avoid ambiguous returns? Bad luck. If you read from an io.Reader and it returns you no error but the read count of 0, what do you do then? When you type match on the return value of the io.Reader.Read and it tells you it read N bytes but it also gives you the EOF error - what do you handle first?Even the basic Go idioms which are touted as great examples of composability and interface application with which I can agree actually have these edge cases of a double-meaning-return. Neither exceptions NOR sum types have this problem, so I guess both camps are unhappy.What does put me off though is that the Go community seems to have this style of examining a possibly arbitrary Go design choice, and then to position it as THE way to write software. Sometimes it is done by denigrating developers who voice their stylistic disagreements with the choices designers have made you are not smart enough to use exceptions , you are not smart enough to use sum types , you are not smart enough to use generics , and sometimes it is done with handwavy statements about code using other idioms being opaque and hard to reason about .I would really appreciate if the Go community could be a bit more mindful of when their praises of language designers sound to people preferring other tech like lecturing or scolding, if you will . For instance because despite some very large projects using Go it might be alienating or othering a lot of people who do not share the enthusiasm or would otherwise use the language and contribute to the ecosystem in a meaningful way just for the sake of getting the job done.

All verified by a provider that s been deemed trustworthy by your browser s developers.Finally, if a certificate is self-signed, it generally should be a large warning to most users the certificate was made by an unknown entity, and anybody may be intercepting the comunication. Power-users understand when self-signed CAs are used, but they don t get scared of red warnings either, so that s not an issue.

Why? Because it would be an easy way to stop waste even if Gates did not think it was a waste .There are other ways to distribute cryptocurrencies, they should definitively ban power consumption for such activities.It doesn t matter that BTC will always do such and such - it s an irrelevant Ponzi scheme.At least the scammers can pick a scam that doesn t involve wasting energy which could be used for literally anything else.
2017-04-06 10:09:07.000	Unix considered harmful I think a demonstrably inhumane environment may be my favourite description to date.There are many terrible assumptions in the design of the shell. Not least Use short commands because they re quicker to type in theory, even though you ll waste time huge amounts of time in practice looking up commands and switches, because even the average god-like greybeard can t remember more than a few tens, and beginners have no chance Use terse switches ditto Text is universal and computers are text processors not true back then, even less true now Make no attempt at standardisation switches are effectively random between different commands Quick hacks are better than a smart and structured environment this was always bullshit and has caused endless grief, not just in Unix, but in everything touched by Unix Software forks are good not in the shell, they re not And now computing is buried under the dead weight of accumulated cruft and poor theory and practice - probably forever.But that isn t even the real problem. The real problem is that research into humane OS design seems to have stalled. CS academics could band together to design something smarter, better, and friendlier than the current shell. But there seems to be zero interest in starting a project that would generate huge productivity and reliability gains and also make low-level computing more accessible to ordinary users.I find that baffling, and actually rather disturbing.

2024-04-22 03:39:20.000	The way I sit while driving is very different from typingTyping I m not able to recline and comfortably type. It s possibly a different chair, desk, keyboard, and monitor setup could help with this but I m self-employed right now and not able to shell that out for what would amount to experiments which I don t expect to be particularly fruitful.I have worked in a number of offices and with a variety of setups when employers were footing the bill, and have yet to find one that was significantly more comfortable than my current setup.When driving I m in much more of a relaxed reclining position and just steering. Long distances I can add cruise control to the mix. Making minor adjustments to the steering wheel is completely different from the wrist fingertip stress of typing, and good posture when working at a desk requires being more upright, which in my experience ends up putting more stress on my back and neck also.

Cannabis is an interesting case because it s been observed in some cases to exacerbate schizophrenic conditions.

2022-02-17 13:06:33.000	I agree it s a positive move to bring formal logic and statistics into other fields, but at least where I m from the social sciences do engage heavily with epistemology. And as a STEM major myself, I ll admit it s often in critical ways that the hard sciences fail.The problem with many attempts to apply statistics is that even for the best quality science, the conclusion is only ever relative to the foundational assumptions. I don t mean they re intentional manipulations, but that it s very clear that Caplan is so far off the mark here that his work is difficult to take seriously.I think a common critique of the trolley problem is an apt analogy here. Not an ethical argument about a specific choice, but that the thought experiment itself is flawed. It presents an absurd binary that neatly removes the human experience and incommensurability of individual life and insists on it s own utilitarian nature.The problem with the spreadsheets, as with the trolley problem is that these kinds of analyses are founded on ad hoc assumptions that conveniently remove important context.There is always a better approach. There are issues with our education system that don t work for many children, and wages do not correlate evenly with education across the board, but the conclusion that we should therefore slash public education funding and transition high schools to vocational training is doesn t follow from that unless you make those trolley-problem-style simplifying assumptions.

There will be some issue of getting enough traction from users that obey the TOS to make the site useful, though.I think crowdsourcing would open up SWmonkey to attack from SW, where SW would flood the channel with conflicting info at a rate that would make the SWmonkey site useless to legitimate customers.Also, most of the companies that offer fare comparisons do not show SW flights... Some of those companies have the tech chops to implement fixes that would comply with the SW site TOS and the massive legal departments to defend their position approach in any and all courts in the world.

At the same time, I doubt you ll see many companies jumping to provide that service, at least not ones that have the experience to handle it appropriately.Wireless internet makes for a very poor product to sell, because the service is unreliable, and often has problems exactly when people want it most during inclement weather . Also, customers often have a problem dissassociating problems that should be expected with the service from problems with the service provider. It s probably not very gratifying to provide what is often the only option people have for high speed internet to have some subset of them that don t understand the reality, or are just too upset to care, disparage your name online. It also probably doesn t lead to securing additional contracts easily, and as soon as other connectivity does become available, your customers will leave at the earliest opportunity there s not a lot of friction to signing up somewhere else when the service is currently down .

2017-02-23 08:00:32.000	When you say client do you mean how humans passing around URLs?No, I mean API clients. I can t come up with any reason why two client applications would be sharing full API URLs directly with each other, that seems like very poor design.URIs are the primary key for resources on the web. If two clients want to talk about the same resources, then they need to agree on an identifier, and that s exactly what URIs are designed for. As for auth a simple token as Github does is enoughThe design criteria in this example is Can be typed into a browser address bar by a non-technical person . I don t think auth tokens meet that criteria. Your choice of HTML 4 HTML 5 for comparison seems aptly poor. Instead of clear versioning, old browsers get HTML they don t understand and fail unexpected, unpredictable and ungratefully ways.You re conflating two different things there how versions are communicated, and the compatibility strategy. Whether or not HTML did a good job of maintaining compatibility between different versions, do you agree that changing the URI of every web page on the web to communicate when they change HTML versions is a bad approach?

On the other hand, Asian family and perhaps true also with other immigrant family tend to have a tighter social network by comparison so perhaps that could be mis-interpreted. The point of my original comment is that it is really more an issue of communication. Parents have a hard time understanding children as well. It is a two-way mirror.

2011-01-28 03:29:33.000	I see this got modded down already, so let s examine the question closer If you re reading this, chances are you re here because you ve read Paul Graham s writing and want to be an entrepreneur. Paul Graham says that jobs are bad things and you should be an entrepreneur instead.The problem is that something like 90 of startups will fail. I bet there are more than a few people on HN who have worked on a startup while receiving unemployment benefits. So if you re on unemployment benefits and decide to do a startup under the table, there s at least some chance something good will happen.The chance that nothing productive will come out of people working in the unemployment GULAG digging the Great Mexican Ditch btw, wouldn t it be cheaper to hire Mexican laborers to dig it? is 100 .Of course, none of this applies to you, because you re a special entrepreneurial snowflake. No one you know or care about has ever, or will ever, be unemployed. But everyone else is supposed to be your wage slave, willing to move across the country to work on your social media startup, cleaning toilets for stock options because, you know, janitorial services is a dead industry . Either that, or they re a welfare queen spending their days snowboarding and playing x-box while sipping champagne and smoking cigars rolled from your tax dollars.And fuck their safety net and their medical care.This is why I have no problem calling out libnerdtarians and other social conservatives. There s a surprising lack of self-awareness, empathy, and the ability to perceive things from other people s perspectives. Some people call it being a sociopath

2024-09-05 13:50:41.000	My personal take on this is ImageMagick is Sendmail Bind OpenSSL class of software - unlimited, constant and guaranted chain of CVE s and other kind of bugs with proven history of that year by year, often each month of the year since the dawn of times and most likely with forever continuation of that track record. And no plans of changing trajectory. If GraphicsMagick is better than that, then it is clearly a benefit of having it around.

In any event, species have been going extinct for almost as long as there have been species. It s unclear that we ve appreciably changed the extinction.And, while one may be scared by species extinction, it s how things work. I m scared of height, but that doesn t imply that someone should do something about height. BTW - we ve probably preserved and enabled species, especially at the low-end, that would have otherwise gone extinct or never come into being.

2022-06-21 21:45:08.000	College is not synonymous with educationRight, that s my question to you, what exactly are you referring to when you say you re anti college the cost or the education?What s the evidence for college being a large net negative? Are you talking about the US only, or are you including, say, Norway too? Are you actually anti college, or anti current US education funding? What do you mean is it needed desirable? Are you suggesting that education alone is a bad thing, or that well rounded non-vocational education is bad for society, that people would be better off not taking math writing history? Is vocational job training unnecessary? Any reason to think it would be equally effective if corporations did it privately, or that it would cost less all else being equal?Currently, the training plus credentialing yields 2x earnings in the US above non college graduates. Whether good or bad, the result is more money moving to society. There is no clear financial net negative, in fact the current financial benefit to society is so large that it s obvious the US govt could fully fund college education for all on the increased tax revenue alone, and still have multiples more than that to spare. I don t yet see your argument at all.

2024-04-16 16:39:07.000	Doctors and lawyers can become programmers far more easily than programmers can become doctors and lawyers though, so though the SV amplification is real, doctors and lawyers can also wreak havoc outside their discipline.I think that s kind of missing the point. Also, I don t think many doctors are making the switch to engineering. Why would they? There are probably far more engineers becoming doctors than vice versa though the total numbers in both directions are likely small .The specific problem with Engineer s disease, is that engineers have the job of building things for others, and thus have the opportunity to force their half-baked ideas onto them. SV has amplified that and turned it into a monster, by elevating things like disruption into something like a moral imperative.The counterpart in finance and the closely related managerialism rival it because those jobs involve control of others.Doctors though? If they get arrogant about some other field, they usually just end up hurting themselves or a few others like they learn to sail, get in over their heads, and sink their ship in a storm . They don t have a mechanism to do more damage.

The answer is obviously no This is not an either or situation. Most likely the emails were illegally stolen but they were also the part of the data that legally needed to be released to the public. Hence the lack of emails with lots of personal details. These emails had already been filtered as part of the preparation process. Just a guess. That and 5 bucks gets you a cup of coffee The crime here, if there is one, is refusal to allow independent verification of process a crime against science and refusal to allow open inspection of work progress an ethical lapse and also perhaps a real crime of fraud, depending on how seriously you take your FOIA laws It s not the end of climate science, just an embarrassing peek at how little clothes the emperor is actually wearing under there. Attempting to prosecute somebody for stealing information that needed to be released to the public anyway would be amusing, at best, to watch.Nothing to see here, please move along.

Having to get up and go into another room to play games meant that games never got played. And then the PC started getting flaky and then it was old and new games didn t look good any more. This happened very quickly.My consoles always work no red ring on my 306 yet, knock on wood and the new games always play great. I m almost definitely getting one of the Microsoft or Sony next-gen consoles. I would definitely consider a steambox as well, as I love the idea of a living room game PC...

I didn t like it as a debater, and I had a dim view of it as a judge, especially from aff side. These frustrations had me drift towards group disco and student congress after 2.5 years in policy.

Sure, on a macro level guns kill fewer people than cars do but there are smart people working hard to try to prevent deaths by cars .Sure, we could and should do better. For example, why doesn t any SUV come standard with built in car seats in the back for infants and children? I watched a ted talk from back in 2009 which asked this question but humans are irrational. They think clearly little Billy is safer if we spend 599 for a car seat.If humans were immune to emotional manipulation then Google stock would crash because basically any advertising is emotional manipulation I think.CBS quotes Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson is facing criticism for a tweet comparing the number of people killed in two mass shootings this weekend to those who died in other ways during the same amount of time. Some perceived the tweet as insensitive, as at least 29 people were left dead and dozens injured in the wake of the tragedies. In the past 48hrs, the USA horrifically lost 34 people to mass shootings, Tyson wrote Sunday afternoon. He then compared the average number of people who die in other ways across any 48hrs. On average, across any 48hrs, we also lose 500 to Medical errors, 300 to the Flu, 250 to Suicide, 200 to Car Accidents, 40 to Homicide via Handgun, he reasoned. Often our emotions respond more to spectacle than to data.

They re just going to continue to release these to make Consumer Reports look increasingly ridiculous in the eyes of the public.Where is the desperation in all this?P.S.

Even in the scenario in your comment, you re presumably still the one driving them around between these activities. Unless you have money to pay someone else to do that for you, which would require quite a bit of money. I don t think that s what most people have in mind when they bring up money concerns -- they re likely much more concerned about affording housing, medical care, clothing, etc for a child.I think the thing with freedom is that they don t want to take on another big responsibility, at the expense of what they already have in their life.

2021-08-11 09:20:04.000	Having both an Open command and an Open, but faster and does less command I personally see this particular feature as redundant given there is already thumbnailing and a means to open files I m guessing neither of you have actually used QuickLook and or don t use apps like Photoshop or Illustrator which, even on a fast SSD equipped laptop can take around 30 seconds to open. QuickLook is much more than just a preview.When I m browsing a folder of my image files and can t remember which of dozens of files is the one I actually want, QuickLook lets me pop open a screen sized modal preview window, which is as good as having that file open in the app. If it s not the file I m looking for, I hit the up or down arrows and the next or previous file s content is displayed in the already open preview popup. If some of those other image files were created by Illustrator, I ve just saved myself an additional 30 seconds, by not having to open that app too. And, once I find the image I want, I can open it in its associated app directly from a button in the top of the preview pane.But, even if you re not a graphic designer, QuickLook has its uses for other types of document too. It can preview the content of source code files with syntax highlighting preview the rendered output of things like HTML, PDF, Markdown, AsciiDoc etc. You can even scroll through the pages of a multipage document.This is another timesaver I use all the time. Being able to check the date or bottom line on a received PDF invoice, without opening it... being able to check whether I mentioned something in a letter I sent, without firing up a text editor or word processor... being able to see a rendered representation of what an HTML file contains... etc. etc.
2013-11-24 20:00:30.000	When the market expands rapidly, but you share does not...My collection of Programming Books Which I Will Discard Before I Ever Move Them Again includes a book about CGI programming with the Korn shell. I am not making this up.As you well know, back in the day when CGI was magic and server-side includes were amazing, there weren t a lot of options for server side programming. You had C, if you were a Unixy systems programmer and didn t mind doing string processing in C. You had Tcl, if you wanted to go the AOLserver route. You had whatever shell script you wanted, if you wanted to pipe and stream together Unixy commands. After a time, you even had server-side JavaScript, if you spent a lot of money on Netscape server products.You also had Perl, which ran on just about every Unix under the sun and behaved the same way pretty much everywhere. Even if you couldn t rely on one Unix utility behaving the same on every Unix variant unless you somehow managed to get the GNU tools installed , you could rely on Perl being just about everywhere. Better yet, it had a fair library of code being developed and published because people were sharing it.In the early days, you might have to use a Perl fork to connect to an Oracle or a Sybase installation, but you even had that option. Yeah, you could do that in C too, but that would be borrowing pain far beyond string handling in C. It s pretty easy to see why Perl ended up with a lot of that market. It fit that niche which hadn t previously existed, and there wasn t much competition. Korn shell. Korn. Shell. The market expanded rapidly. Then the competition expanded rapidly because the market expanded rapidly. It s innumerate to suggest that the relative position of market share will remain the same or even grow when the market grows so rapidly and so much competition appears.

No arguments. The machine is right by definition, and has calculated precisely what is for your own good using scientific data.And don t bother arguing. You re only making it worse for yourself.

It would be like the authority of a parent if, like that authority, its object was to prepare men for manhood but it seeks, on the contrary, to keep them in perpetual childhood it is well content that the people should rejoice, provided they think of nothing but rejoicing. For their happiness such a government willingly labors, but it chooses to be the sole agent and the only arbiter of that happiness it provides for their security, foresees and supplies their necessities, facilitates their pleasures, manages their principal concerns, directs their industry, regulates the descent of property, and subdivides their inheritances what remains, but to spare them all the care of thinking and all the trouble of living?

2017-12-18 18:01:11.000	That s pretty funny, but EventFactoryFactoryFactory isn t exactly Java s fault.There s a software development culture that believes adding a layer of abstraction is the answer doesn t matter what the problem is as long as it has a GoF pattern name doesn t even need the implement the pattern its named for .For whatever reason they ve adopted Java, but if you re going to throw abstractions on top of abstractions carelessly you re going to create a mess of spaghetti no matter the language or environment. I think the preference for Java is just an accident of timing of when the culture arose. The responsibilities of corporate IT groups were exploding and they needed a language for all the software they had to create. Java was there and it was a good choice. I m feeling bad about my laughing and complaining, which is useless, so here s some practical advice on restraint when it comes to using abstractions and patterns Don t use an abstraction to wrap something you don t understand well. You may feel like you ve tamed a confusing, complicated API and turned it into something you do understand and can use effectively. But you ve actually just rolled up all the things to didn t account for and don t understand and hidden them away from view where they will explode if your software actually sees much use. I realize this isn t always easy to avoid doing, but at least never wrap something in an abstraction because you don t understand it that well. And when you re forced to implement an abstraction on top of an API you don t understand well, go through the API, method or function or endpoint or whatever by method, and look at all the options and ask yourself what each of those options and methods are there for. When considering using a pattern, make sure to check the section titled something like When Does This Pattern Apply? and make sure the abstraction you re considering actually solves the problem.

Like housing. My parents had a huge house and property by the time they turned 30. While some people still buy houses in their 20s, they re usually small shit houses with tiny properties. 1 The whole computer thing, generally much better healthcare, much better daycare offerings if you re the sort of person that wants or has to give her children away, etc. or even things like being able to buy a used car for 5k with excellent interior, crash safety and gimmicks. But you of course can t afford to fuel it, so maybe that s a moot point .

2021-04-24 07:52:46.000	I ve watched the video as far as Timothy Gowers sets out the problem. Now here s my attempt at a mental-arithmetic solution plan 1. For any n, attempt to do an LU decomposition of the Pascal matrix P into the product of lower-triangular matrix L and upper-triangular matrix U.2. By symmetry, these should be mirror-images of one another in the leading diagonal.3. det L det U det P , which we know is 1. Also, by symmetry det L det U , which must then be either 1 or -1. The simplest approach would be to guess that is 1 and that the leading diagonal is all 1s.4. Induct the first 3 cases, by mental arithmetic to reach 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 2 1 2 3 1 2 1 0 0 1 1 3 6 5. Guess that L and U are also Pascal s triangle arranged as rows and columns respectively.6. Compute the bottom right corner for a couple more cases as a check 1 2 3 2 3 2 1 2 20 1 2 4 2 6 2 4 2 1 2 70 ... seems OK. So I guess, for the bottom right corner there s a binomial identity something like sum_ k 0 n binom n k binom n k binom 2n n and a more general version of that identity for the cell i,j with 0 sum_ k 0 n binom i k binom j k binom i j n on an n 1 x n 1 matrix.

They transitioning in a shitty manor, but I m not sure they have much choice, other than turn their back to Windows 7 and 8 users.I have co-workers that when they where upgraded to a later version of Windows on our terminal server wanted to know Can t we just stay on Windows XP.

2022-09-22 17:58:24.000	I suppose the monero userbase has similar attitudes as the early bitcoin userbase, but monero cryptonote is not a bitcoin fork in the same sense that zcash zerocoin is. we could just iterate on existing ones, and have our userbase intact without having to gain traction for an entirely new alt-coin.I think there are some fundamental limits to the throughput of a single cryptocurrency due to network latency and bandwidth. Perhaps the solution to scalability is simply to have multiple cryptocurrencies and to facilitate atomic swaps between them. So in this sense, the creation of new cryptocurrencies with minor feature changes litecoin, bitcoin cash, wownero, cheapeth, etc. is actually good for network diversity.That being said, the owners of existing big cryptocurrencies will usually want to make changes that increase its usability to compete with these trivial forks Bitcoiners have been soured by the idea of a hard fork since the XT dispute, while the monero userbase has commited itself to regular hard forks every 6 months to upgrade the network.

On the couple of relatively-small subreddits i visit, i feel the same too.But i could be wrong of course. Maybe the tone of an HN poster is super easy for an LLM to copy there s a reason why shit HN says exists after all. The only reason i have to believe otherwise is that, in comparison, Instagram or Twitter bots are so obvious and bland, and those companies have way more resources to throw at AI than HN or reddit P

However, I believe that if it were written in JavaScript, the situation would be similar.The bot is rarely used, so on average, it only uses 0.06 of my machine s CPU power. However, it consumes 3 of the RAM at the same time. --smol switch according to Jarred s tests reduces memory usage 7 times by increasing CPU usage just 2x times. In my case such redistribution of resource consumption would be a clear win!To save RAM, I actually switched to a 32-bit Python base image. This switch resulted in a 30 reduction in RAM usage.

2017-01-03 20:58:38.000	I agree that a big part of the solution lies in retraining -- as a new way of life. In the future, no job will last long. We all must retrain continuously.But making training the new norm will require big changes to the status quo of how companies retain skilled employees.First, we need a much better model for skill credentialism. College degrees are way too slow, too broad, and rarely meet the specific immediate needs of business. Some sort of microdegree equal to 1-4 college courses and more substantial than today s pop MOOCs sound about right. But their instruction model also needs to be much more flexible and time-insensitive, so working people aren t locked into semester-based schedules. And student social interaction in MOOCs needs to be much improved over the 1990-era forum message chains I ve seen.Second, we need to encourage employers to spend money and time for retraining. And in return, we need to assure them their newly-skilled employee won t soon take their newfound skills and hop to a better paying job. This requires a contract like those between employees unions and employers in Europe, but largely absent in the US.Third, employees probably will have to change jobs more frequently. Thus the system needs to make these job hops smoother, steadying employee cashflow to support long-term debt like mortgages, and minimize risks like making health care coverage liquid and independent of employers.Unfortunately such big changes will require all involved -- employees, educators, insurers, and employers -- to discard their venerated focus on short-term ROI and cost reduction. Unfortunately existing US practices seem almost perfectly unprepared to act gracefully and quickly. While in contrast, Germany, with its longstanding state support for low-cost education, mobile health insurance, union-business partnerships, and skilled jobs that don t require college degrees, seems ideally positioned.And of course all this has to happen pretty quickly, while we John Henrys can still compete with the machines.

2011-06-09 09:59:02.000	It codifies the relationships between the parts - but also adds ceremony the call, the method definition, the arguments . Whether this is a net gain depends. Probably the key is whether it feels like a conceptually distinct component - a theory or abstraction that you can build on. This is probably true even if it isn t reused but typically coincides with it .There was some non-linearity the interaction between parts increases roughly with the square of the number of parts 4 parts have 16 directed interactions. Combinatorial explosion is a more accurate measure. If you can separate the parts into modules, that interact with only the caller, then the complexity increases linearly but if many methods need to interact, then it s as if you wrapped all the cables up in one tie, and forced them all to go through the main method - not actually an improvement. However, it s rare for everything to interact with everything, and even then, it may be clearer to codify it somehow .I also wanted to say that while proving correctness is important, the organization that is best for proving is not always the same organization that is best for human clarity sometimes they are . It depends on what your goal is. Proving absolute correctness is not important for most programs all software has bugs bugfixes are common - to sacrifice human clarity for correctness is usually not the optimal trade-off.

2014-03-11 01:51:21.000	Anything where you want an image to be guaranteed consistent, even if not complete, could use an ordering guarantee without a particular this has been written now guarantee. A log-structured data store where you don t mind a bit of data loss if there s a power outage is a particularly clear example of that, but it s a useful property in general.So a little bit of data loss is okay, but a lot isn t? How does a program or operator determine how much is okay and how much isn t? How does the application ensure that that limit isn t exceeded? Without answers to these questions, it feels like you ll probably be fine, but I can t be sure of anything , which feels pretty lame. But if a little data loss really is okay, then forget about both ordering and fsync and truncate the log after the last consecutive valid record. The problem appears to be that today there s only write this all out now and DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ELSE until that happens , and yeah, whatever, write it whatever order you like and I sure hope it all works out. Is that correct?I don t think so, but it depends on what you mean by absolutely nothing else . You can always use other threads, and on most systems, you can do lots of useful I O with reasonable performance while an fsync is going on. There really isn t anything like a write barrier?Other than fsync and equivalents, I don t know of one. Non-blocking write barriers would represent a much more complicated abstraction for both applications and the filesystem, and as you can tell from my comments on this thread I m not convinced it s worth the complexity for any rigorous program.

2019-11-01 00:50:33.000	We feel like there is a difference between those 2 cases because we experience a continuity in our experience of the universe ie. consciousness .Under this premise as you stated , copying your entire state and spawning it elsewhere then killing the original means your original version experiences a stopping of their continuity.But if you analyze that premise, you realize that the only reason we believe we existed a second ago is because of our memory the same reason the clone believes it was always alive .How can you know that you aren t being cloned, in-place, right now? ie. Copied, killed, and spawned in place almost instantaneously. At every instant you carry all your memories and thus feel continuity, but it s a new you.In this view, being killed and spawned elsewhere is no different. It isn t taking anything away from you because you never had it.Obviously this is just a thought experiment, but just the fact that right now, while you were questioning if being cloned and killed was bad for the original you, this process could have been happening to you without your knowledge, might mean it is irrelevant.

Where s the logical link between getting shown some old photos of you and having your reaction to difficult moments controlled by algorithms?Also the article claims we ve outsourced our memories to Google. In that scenario those memories which would have been long forgotten were already outsourced to photos. Google is just a platform to store it on and that is more of an opinion against cloud privacy than against Google.

2023-10-21 14:29:10.000	The position of the Attorney General in KS. While usually they do ask in order to preserve peace, the state doesn t feel they are required to. We believe the duty enjoined upon the appraiser to value real property from an actual view and inspection of the property carries with it the implied authority for the appraiser to enter upon real property to perform this duty, without such action constituting a trespass. However, we also believe that all persons, perhaps especially governmental officers, owe a duty to preserve the public peace. Therefore, it is our opinion that for the limited purpose of appraising a taxpayer s real property and the improvements made thereon, by actual view and inspection, an appraiser may enter upon such property, at a reasonable time, without the prior permission of the taxpayer.

2018-04-25 09:20:51.000	I don t think it s evolutionary at all - people who associate with some animal types convince themselves they re in a bilateral open relationship the animal is choosing to be their friend , or even adopt a mental attitude where they use the animal as a proxy for a human infant.This seems the result of socialisation in to that behaviour.In the UK, outside food chain fraud, we don t eat horse, but plenty of other countries do - I don t think that s because we evolved differently.

Leaving it at home is much harder of a boundary to cross without knowing.
2014-10-18 22:17:25.000	It seems that there are many studies that have compared mono and multilingual people. I wonder if similar studies have been conducted comparing a group of adults who are complacent with their mental development to a group who ve made a conscious choice to actively pursue a deep understanding of a new subject that interests them.I love learning new languages, but I understand that others may not. They shouldn t be restricted to endure learning another language just to achieve the cognitive advantages discussed in this article. There must exist other options that better suit their interests. Even if the newly acquired knowledge skill must be relative to communication, there are more ways to express one s thoughts than written and verbal language.

That s the ideal case. Find a real bottleneck money, cpu, memory, ? and rethink your architecture accordingly, find the next real bottleneck and so on.

2020-02-11 23:26:18.000	ARM SecureZone is an odd choice on a platform that s aiming to be highly trusted. It s got a very weak security model compared to isolated TPMs like the two that they have on-board as well . The boot-chaining on this looks like it s entirely reliant on the TrustZone separation, not on either of the two on-board TPMs, nu?

Same SSD, RAM, and GPU. The MBP has a slightly faster CPU, i7 2.3Ghz instead of DELL s i7 2.2Ghz. The DELL is 10 cheaper.
2015-08-27 23:18:14.000	Absent regulation, the cab business has very low barriers to entry. Other direct sales businesses with low barriers to entry such as street peddling, door-to-door sales, food trucks, etc. are also typically regulated or banned. Sales businesses which require renting owning retail space have a much stiffer entry barrier and inherent limits on crowding, but many types of them are still regulated in various ways liquor licenses, restaurant licenses, salon licenses ... .Or in other words, cabs aren t unique.

2023-07-15 20:44:12.000	To me, you kind of hit both the pros and cons of checked exceptions. It makes the calling code have to deal with an important error case. This is actually super useful for very important error situations for instance, let s say you re writing some type of file-processing class, and the class was unable to open the file for some reason, it might be a good situation to throw a checked exception as this can probably happen reasonably often .To me, the difficulty with exceptions is when writing a method that needs to throw an exception is deciding whether it should throw one that is actually checked. In fact, read a few of years ago most exceptions should actually be unchecked, but at least then, this was still greatly up for debate.... as I type this, am realizing having the option of unchecked and checked exceptions is nice in that they reduce the amount error code you have to write. Because by throwing unchecked exceptions, this is error handling that all the entire calling code-chain doesn t need to deal with. The obvious situations are system errors like out of memory errors, missing resources... but also those programmatic errors that are unexpected, like array out of bounds, ClassCastException.Also, the calling chain then has the option to handle it if it s needed. For instance, if you re writing a low-level messaging queue that needs to report system errors btw, this was a real situation that happened to me . Just my two cents.

Trivial and immaterial incrementalism perfectly conform to our business cycle.
2013-10-16 14:51:11.000	I am not sure about Android development these days, but 2 years ago cross-device support was horrible, yes. I think Android 4 solved most if not all of these complaints by standardizing core aspects of the system. You still have a whole bunch of devices running on Android 4, so you do have to invest more time in 100 device coverage, yes. It is an advantage that with Apple there are only a handful of devices with tight integration in the SDK, but due to its openness Android was and still is to an extinct very segmented.

2023-09-10 17:00:18.000	I think ironically this causes the Jetstream and polar vortex to breakdown, the polar vortex is what keeps arctic air from dipping further south, if the vortex fails we could be ushered into an ice age where the feedback loop is reversed. more ice, more reflection, more ice. at least that s what I learned on a YouTube video recently some meteorologist channel .it s amazing how many runaway feedback loops can take us to extreme heat or cold near the extinction line either way. I think we could weather an ice age, but I think billions wouldn t make it. We d create underground homes with lights to grow food or something in a space station or on the moon.We re pretty resourceful, I think it d take more than that to take us out. An asteroid is much more certain extinction, unless we do have an actual colony in space or on the moon.
